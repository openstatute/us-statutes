First - Registration shall be conducted in each county by a board of three reputable and suitable persons resident in the county, who shall not hold any elective office during their term, to be appointed, within sixty days after the ratification of this Constitution, by the governor, auditor, and commissioner of agriculture and industries, or by a majority of them acting as a board of appointment. If one or more of the persons appointed on such a board of registration shall refuse, neglect, or be unable to qualify or serve, or if a vacancy or vacancies occur in the membership of the board of registrars from any cause, the governor, auditor, and commissioner of agriculture and industries, or a majority of them, acting as a board of appointment, shall make other appointments to fill such board. Each registrar shall receive two dollars per day, to be paid by the state, and disbursed by the several judges of probate, for each entire day's attendance upon the session of the board. Before entering upon the performance of the duties of his office, each registrar shall take the same oath required of the judicial officers of the state, which oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths. The oath shall be in writing and subscribed by the registrar, and filed in the office of the judge of probate of the county.

Second - Prior to the first day of August, nineteen hundred and two, the board of registrars in each county shall visit each precinct at least once, and oftener if necessary, to make a complete registration of all persons entitled to register, and shall remain there at least one day from eight o'clock in the morning until sunset. They shall give at least twenty days' notice of the time when, and the place in the precinct where, they will attend to register applicants for registration, by bills posted at five or more public places in each election precinct, and by advertisement once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper, if there be one published in the county. Upon failure to give such notice, or to attend any appointment made by them in any precinct, they shall, after like notice, fill new appointments therein; but the time consumed by the board in completing such registration shall not exceed sixty working days in any county, except that in counties of more than nine hundred square miles in area, such board may consume seventy-five working days in completing the registration, and except that in counties in which there is any city of eight thousand or more inhabitants, the board may remain in session, in addition to the time hereinbefore prescribed, for not more than three successive weeks in each of such cities; and thereafter the board may sit from time to time in each of such cities not more than one week in each month, and except that in the county of Jefferson the board may hold an additional session of not exceeding five consecutive days' duration for each session, in each town or city of more than one thousand and less than eight thousand inhabitants. No person shall be registered except at the county site or in the precinct in which he resides. The registrars shall issue to each person registered a certificate of registration.

Third - The board of registrars shall not register any person between the first day of August, nineteen hundred and two, and the Friday next preceding the day of election in November, nineteen hundred and two. On Friday and Saturday next preceding the day of election in November, nineteen hundred and two, they shall sit in the courthouse of each county during such days, and shall register all applicants having the qualifications prescribed by section 180 of this Constitution and not disqualified under section 182, who shall have reached the age of twenty-one years after the first day of August, nineteen hundred and two, or who shall prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the board that, by reason of physical disability or unavoidable absence from the county, they had no opportunity to register prior to the first day of August, nineteen hundred and two, and they shall not on such days register any other persons. When there are two or more courthouses in a county, the registrars may sit during such two days at the courthouse they may select, but shall give ten days' notice, by bills posted at each of the courthouses, designating the courthouse at which they will sit.

Fourth - The board of registrars shall hold sessions at the courthouse of their respective counties during the entire third week in November, nineteen hundred and two, and for six working days next prior to the twentieth day of December, nineteen hundred and two, during which sessions they shall register all persons applying who possess the qualifications prescribed in section 180 of this Constitution, and who shall not be disqualified under section 182. In counties where there are two or more courthouses the board of registrars shall divide the time equally between them. The board of registrars shall give notice of the time and place of such sessions by posting notices at each courthouse in their respective counties, and at each voting place and at three other public places in the county, and by publication once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper, if one be published in the county; such notices to be posted and such publications to be commenced as early as practicable in the first week of November, nineteen hundred and two. Failure on the part of the registrars to conform to the provisions of this article as to the giving of the required notices shall not invalidate any registration made by them.

Fifth - The board of registrars shall have power to examine, under oath or affirmation, all applicants for registration, and to take testimony touching the qualifications of such applicants. Each member of such board is authorized to administer the oath to be taken by the applicants and witnesses, which shall be in the following form, and subscribed by the person making it, and preserved by the board, namely: "I solemnly swear (or affirm) that in the matter of the application of ... for registration as an elector, I will speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God." Any person who upon such examination makes any willfully false statement in reference to any material matter touching the qualification of any applicant for registration shall be guilty of perjury, and upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than five years.

Sixth - The action of the majority of the board of registrars shall be the action of the board, and a majority of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of all business. Any person to whom registration is denied shall have the right of appeal, without giving security for costs, within thirty days after such denial, by filing a petition in the circuit court or court of like jurisdiction held for the county in which he seeks to register, to have his qualifications as an elector determined. Upon the filing of the petition the clerk of the court shall give notice thereof to any solicitor authorized to represent the state in said county, whose duty it shall be to appear and defend against the petition on behalf of the state. Upon such trial the court shall charge the jury only as to what constituted the qualifications that entitled the applicant to become an elector at the time he applied for registration, and the jury shall determine the weight and effect of the evidence and return a verdict. From the judgment rendered an appeal will lie to the supreme court in favor of the petitioner, to be taken within thirty days. Final judgment in favor of the petitioner shall entitle him to registration as of the date of his application to the registrars.

Seventh - The secretary of state shall, at the expense of the state, have prepared and shall furnish to the registrars and judges of probate of the several counties, a sufficient number of registration books and of blank forms of the oath, certificates of registration and notices required to be given by the registrars. The cost of the publication in newspapers of the notices required to be given by the registrars shall be paid by the state, the bills therefor to be rendered to the secretary of state and approved by him.

Eighth - Any person who registers for another, or who registers more than once, and any registrar who enters the name of any person on the list of registered voters, without such person having made application in person under oath on a form provided for that purpose, or who knowingly registers any person more than once, or who knowingly enters a name upon the registration list as the name of a voter, without any one of that name applying to register, shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than five years.

The legislature shall have the power to levy and collect taxes for state purposes on net incomes from whatever source derived within this state, including the incomes derived from salaries, fees and compensation paid from the state, county, municipality, and any agency or creature thereof, for the calendar year, 1933, and thereafter and to designate and define the incomes to be taxed and to fix the rates of taxes, provided that the rate shall not exceed 5 percent nor 3 percent on corporations. Income shall not be deemed property for purposes of ad valorem taxes. From net income an exemption of not less than fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00) shall be allowed to unmarried persons and an exemption of not less than three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) shall be allowed to the head of a family, provided that only one exemption shall be allowed to husband and wife where they are living together and make separate returns for income tax.

In addition to any indebtedness now authorized, Jefferson county may become indebted and may issue bonds therefor in an amount not exceeding 3 percent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in said county in order to pay the expenses of constructing, improving, extending and repairing sewers and sewerage treatment and disposal plants in said county. Said bonds shall be general obligations of Jefferson county but shall also be payable primarily from and secured by a lien upon the sewer rentals or service charges, which shall be levied and collected in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds, replacements, extensions and improvements to, and the cost of operation and maintenance of, the sewers and sewerage treatment and disposal plants. Such sewer rentals or service charges shall be levied upon and collected from the persons and property whose sewerage is disposed of or treated by the sewers or the sewerage treatment or disposal plants and whether served by the part of the sewer system then being constructed, improved, or extended or by some other part of such system; and such charges or rentals shall be a personal obligation of the occupant of the property the sewerage from which is disposed of by such sewers or treated in such plants and shall also be a lien upon such property, enforceable by a sale thereof.

Before issuing any bonds or levying or collecting any such sewer service charges or rentals, the proposal shall first be submitted to and approved by a majority of the voters of the county voting at an election to be called by the governing body thereof. Notice of such election shall be given by publication once a week for four successive weeks immediately prior to such election in a newspaper published and of general circulation in Jefferson county. Such notice and the ballot shall set forth the purpose for which the bonds are proposed to be issued, the estimated cost of the proposed undertaking, the amount of bonds to be issued, the serial maturities thereof, and the maximum rate of interest such bonds are to bear, and a recital that the proposal includes the levying of sewer service charges or rentals to be secured by liens upon the property served.

With the prior approval of the governing body of any incorporated municipality therein, Jefferson county may take over, own, possess, control, expand, improve, maintain and operate any sewers or sewerage treatment or disposal plants of such incorporated municipality or, if such incorporated municipality has no sewers, Jefferson county may construct sewers therein. Such sewers and plants shall thereupon become a part of a combined and consolidated sewer system for Jefferson county.

The governing body of Jefferson county shall have full power and authority to manage, operate, control and administer the sewers and plants herein provided for and, to that end, may make any reasonable and nondiscriminatory rules and regulations fixing rates and charges, providing for the payment, collection and enforcement thereof, and the protection of its property.

The bonds shall be the general obligation of the state of Alabama and the full faith and credit and taxing power of the state are hereby pledged to the punctual payment of the bonds and the interest thereon. The aggregate principal amount of all bonds issued hereunder shall not exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000) and they shall mature within ten years from the date of issuance.

The proceeds from the sale of such bonds are hereby appropriated and shall be used solely for the construction of hospitals and hospital facilities pursuant to Act No. 211, S. 107, approved July 7, 1945 (General Acts of Alabama, 1945, page 330), or any act supplemental thereto or amendatory thereof; provided, that the funds appropriated hereby shall be used only for the construction of hospitals, clinics, or health centers under contracts which have been or are let on or after May 1, 1949, and that the funds shall be used to match federal funds available for hospital, clinic or health center purposes, and that the local governments in the area where each hospital, clinic or health center is to be built shall contribute at least as much money for the construction as does the state; and provided further that the state shall not contribute more than three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000) to the construction of any one hospital, clinic or health center.

In determining where a hospital, clinic or health center to be constructed with the funds appropriated herein shall be located, first consideration shall be given to communities which have no hospital, clinic or health center facilities. Each county having no hospital, clinic or health center facilities shall be entitled to an allotment of not less than sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) for such facilities if application is made therefore before January 1 of each year. Any funds available for hospital, clinic or health center facilities remaining on January 1 of each year after allotments have been made to those counties having no such facilities and having not already received an allotment and which have made application therefor may be allotted to those counties having such facilities which have made application therefor. However, counties receiving prior allotments hereunder shall not be precluded from receiving a larger allotment or an additional allotment at the discretion of the state board of health.

District tuberculosis sanitoria in the districts set up in Act No. 287, S. 22, approved July 7, 1945 [Acts 1945, p. 474], shall be eligible for construction under the provisions of this amendment, and 25 percent of the proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized by this amendment shall be reserved for the construction of tuberculosis sanitoria; provided, at the end of each calendar year funds not obligated for either general or tuberculosis hospital construction may be used during the next year for either type construction; and provided further, that the local governments or authorities in the area where the sanitorium is to be built shall contribute at least as much money as does the state. A sum not to exceed forty thousand dollars ($40,000) may be used by the state board of health for hospital administration for each of the two (2) years ending in 1950, and 1951; this appropriation shall be cumulative.

(b) All bonds issued hereunder and interest thereon shall be payable from any funds in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated. The bonds shall be payable in substantially equal installments of principal and interest beginning in the next fiscal year after their date; they shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding two percent per annum payable semi-annually; and they shall contain a provision for their call for payment at such a time or times prior to maturity, and at such a premium, if any, as the governor may prescribe. All bonds issued hereunder shall be sold to the highest bidder at a duly advertised public sale, on sealed bids or at auction, and shall not be sold for less than par and accrued interest; provided, bidders may be invited to name the rate of interest which the bonds are to bear, in which case the bonds shall not be sold at a price which would yield more than two percent according to standard bond tables, taking into account the discount and call privilege.

If a majority of the qualified electors of any county in the state, except Mobile and Jefferson counties, who participate in an election held therein pursuant to the provisions of any amendment to the Constitution heretofore adopted shall vote at such election in favor of the levy and collection of a special county tax, within the limitations provided in such amendment, for any one or more of the purposes included within the meaning of the term public hospital purposes, the proceeds derived from the tax authorized at such election may be applied for any one or more of the purposes for which said tax may be so voted. Whenever the tax shall be voted the governing body of the county may anticipate the proceeds therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall be voted by issuing, without further election, interest bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of not exceeding 75% of the annual proceeds from said tax received by the county.

The governing body of each county in which the said tax may be voted shall have the further power to designate as the agency of the county to acquire, construct, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county under any general law heretofore or hereafter enacted by the legislature. When a public corporation shall be so designated, the proceeds of said tax thereafter collected shall be paid over to it and shall be used by it for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payment of the proceeds of said tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result in the impairment of the obligation of any contract theretofore made with respect to said tax. Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said public corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon not exceeding 75% of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

Each county in which the tax shall be voted, and in the event a public corporation shall have been designated as the agency of such county pursuant to the provisions hereof then said public corporation, shall have the power to contract with any other county or similar public corporation with respect to the acquisition by purchase, lease, or otherwise, and the construction, equipment, operation, and maintenance of public hospital facilities outside of the county and within any zone or region of which the county may be a part, and which may have heretofore been established or may hereafter be established for public hospital purposes by the legislature or by any agency designated by it, the obligations of such contract to be payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax; provided, that the proceeds of said tax shall not be used outside of the county for any purpose for which the proceeds could not be used in the county, and shall not be used with respect to public hospital facilities located outside of the county if the tax is voted specifically for public hospital facilities located in the county.

No securities issued or contracts made by a county under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of the county or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities shall be construed to be negotiable instruments notwithstanding the fact that they may be payable solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.

In each instance in which a special county tax for any one or more of the purposes included within the meaning of the term "public hospital purposes" has heretofore been authorized at an election held in a county pursuant to the provisions of any amendment to the Constitution heretofore adopted, all provisions of this amendment shall be applicable in said county to the same extent as if said election had been held after the adoption of this amendment.

Should a tax of less than five mills on each dollar's worth of taxable property be approved at an election thereon then at the expiration of one year from the date of the election at which such tax was approved, and at intervals of one year thereafter, the question of levying an additional tax for such purposes may again be submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the county until the total of all taxes levied pursuant to the authority hereby conferred is five mills.

After any tax levied pursuant to authority hereby conferred shall have been collected for five years the court of county commissioners, board of revenue or other county governing body, upon receipt of a petition, signed by not less than twenty percent of the qualified electors of the county must call an election at which the question of repeal of the tax upon payment of all obligations then outstanding shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the county. Should a majority of the voters participating at this election vote for the repeal of the tax it shall cease as soon as the outstanding pledges against it have been paid in full. Should a majority of the electors participating in the election vote against repeal the question of repeal may not again be submitted to a vote for one year, but after the expiration of one year, and at intervals of one year thereafter, upon receipt of a petition signed by twenty percent of the qualified electors of the county, the county governing body may order the question of repeal of the tax resubmitted to the qualified electors of the county.

Sec. 256. Educational policy of the state; authority of legislature to provide for or authorize establishment and operation of schools by persons, municipalities, etc.; grant, donation, sale or lease of funds and property for educational purposes; election of certain schools for attendance by parents of minors.

It is the policy of the state of Alabama to foster and promote the education of its citizens in a manner and extent consistent with its available resources, and the willingness and ability of the individual student, but nothing in this Constitution shall be construed as creating or recognizing any right to education or training at public expense, nor as limiting the authority and duty of the legislature, in furthering or providing for education, to require or impose conditions or procedures deemed necessary to the preservation of peace and order.

The legislature may by law provide for or authorize the establishment and operation of schools by such persons, agencies or municipalities, at such places, and upon such conditions as it may prescribe, and for the grant or loan of public funds and the lease, sale or donation of real or personal property to or for the benefit of citizens of the state for educational purposes under such circumstances and upon such conditions as it shall prescribe.

Except as they may be specifically set aside in trust funds or otherwise applied to the payment of indebtedness, all proceeds of income or other taxes levied by the state, and of all special ad valorem or other taxes levied by counties and other municipalities, or school districts, pursuant to the Constitution as heretofore amended, for public school purposes, shall be applied to the support and furtherance of education pursuant to section 256 of the Constitution, as amended.

Sec. 270. Applicability of article to Mobile county.

The provisions of this article and of any act of the legislature passed in pursuance thereof for educational purposes, shall apply to Mobile county only so far as to authorize and require the authorities designated by law to draw the portions of the funds to which said county shall be entitled for school purposes and to make reports to the superintendent of education as may be prescribed by law; and all special incomes and powers of taxation as now authorized by law for the benefit of public schools in said county shall remain undisturbed until otherwise provided by the legislature.

The bonds shall be general obligations of the state of Alabama and the full faith and credit and taxing power of the state are hereby pledged to the prompt and faithful payment of the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon.

The bonds may be sold, executed and delivered at any time and from time to time, may be in such forms, denominations, series and numbers, may be of such tenor and maturities, may bear such date or dates, may be in registered or bearer form either as principal or interest or both with rights of conversion into another form, may be payable in such installments and at such place or places, may bear interest at such rate or rates payable and evidenced in such manner, and may contain provisions for redemption at the option of the state to be exercised by said board at such date or dates prior to their maturity and upon payment of such redemption price or prices, all as shall be provided by the said board in the resolution or resolutions whereunder the bonds are issued.

None of the bonds shall be sold for less than face value plus accrued interest thereon to the date of delivery, and all of the bonds shall be sold only at public sale or sales, either on sealed bids or at public auction, after such advertisement as may be prescribed by the said board, to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest net interest cost to the state computed to the respective maturities of the bonds sold; provided, that if no bid deemed acceptable by the said board is received all bids may be rejected.

The bonds shall be signed in the name of the state by the governor and countersigned by the president pro tempore of the board of trustees of the University of Alabama and the great seal of the state of Alabama or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and shall be attested by the signature of the secretary of state; provided that facsimile signatures of any one or any two (but not all) of said officers may be reproduced on such bonds in lieu of their manually signing the same. Coupons attached to the bonds and representing installments of interest thereon shall be signed with the facsimile signature of the state treasurer, which facsimile signature is hereby adopted as due and sufficient authentication of said coupons.

The funds provided hereby shall be used for construction and equipping facilities under contracts which have been or are let on or after July 1, 1961; shall be used to match federal funds available for hospital, health center, and related medical facilities provided under Public Law 725, 79th Congress and Public Law 482, 83rd Congress, as said public laws are now or may hereafter be amended; and that the local governments in the area where each hospital, health center, or related medical facility is to be constructed or equipped shall contribute at least as much money for the construction and equipping as does the state; and provided further that the state shall not contribute more than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for any facility included within the scope of this amendment.

In determining where a hospital, health center, or related medical facility to be constructed with funds appropriated herein shall be located, consideration shall be given to the communities on the basis of relative need. Counties receiving prior allotments hereunder shall not be precluded from receiving an additional allotment for other facilities at the discretion of the state board of health. A sum not to exceed sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) may be used by the state board of health from the proceeds of the sale of said bonds for administering the provision of this amendment.

When each series of said bonds is issued, the maturities of the bonds of that series shall, to the extent as may be practicable, be so arranged that during any then succeeding fiscal year of the state the aggregate installments of principal and interest that will mature of all of the said bonds that will be outstanding hereunder, immediately following the issuance of the bonds of that series, will be substantially equal; provided, that the determination in the order under which the bonds of such series are issued that the requirements of this sentence have been complied with shall be conclusive of such compliance and the purchasers of the bonds with respect to which such determination is made and all subsequent holders thereof shall be fully protected thereby.

Each such election shall be called, held and conducted, and may be contested, in the manner provided by law for county or municipal bond elections, as the case may be. Bonds issued under the authority of this amendment shall not be considered indebtedness of the county or the city, as the case may be, within the meaning of sections 224 and 225 of the Constitution of Alabama, but neither the county nor the city shall at any time issue any bonds under the authority of this amendment if as a result thereof it will have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of bonds issued hereunder in excess of twenty per cent of the assessed value of the property in the county or the city, as the case may be.

If the majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment should not vote in favor of the adoption of this amendment, or if the majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county voting at any election held under the provisions of this amendment should not vote in favor of the issuance of the bonds proposed at such election, the governing body of Mobile county may from time to time call other elections hereunder on the issuance of such bonds, but not more than one such election shall be held during any period of twelve months.

The bonds issued hereunder shall be general obligations of Mobile county for the payment of the principal of and interest on which the full faith and credit of said county shall be irrevocably pledged, and in addition thereto there shall be irrevocably pledged for payment of said principal and interest, at the respective maturities thereof, so much as may be necessary for said purpose of the said special tax, each such pledge to be on a parity with all valid pledges of said special tax at any time made, to such extent as shall not impair the obligation of then existing valid pledges. The principal of each series of bonds issued under the provisions of this amendment shall mature in annual installments, the first of which installments shall mature not later than three (3) years after the date of the bonds of said series and the last of which shall mature not later than thirty (30) years after the date of the bonds of said series; provided, that the maturities of each series of bonds issued hereunder shall be so arranged at the time of the issuance of such series of bonds that (a) no annual installment of principal of the bonds of such series maturing during any fiscal year of said county shall be more than four times as great as the smallest installment of principal of the same series maturing during any prior fiscal year, and (b) the aggregate amount of principal and interest that will mature in any one fiscal year with respect to that series of bonds, and all other bonds then outstanding that are payable out of or secured by a pledge of the aforesaid special tax, shall not exceed the amount of the proceeds collected from the said tax during the then next preceding tax year. Except as herein otherwise provided, all bonds issued hereunder shall be issued in accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of the general laws of Alabama existing at the time of the issuance of such bonds respecting the sale, execution, issuance, and redemption of bonds by counties. The indebtedness evidenced by the bonds issued hereunder or under any other amendment to the constitution which are payable out of or secured by a pledge of said special tax shall be in addition to and shall not be charged against the limitation on the indebtedness of said county provided for in Section 224 of the constitution.

For payment of the principal of and interest on all bonds that may be issued hereunder, and so long as any of said principal and interest remains unpaid, the governing body of Mobile county is hereby authorized to continue the levy of the said special annual ad valorem tax provided for in said Amendment XVIII [18] at such rate as may be sufficient to pay such principal and interest at their respective maturities; provided, that the total rate of said special tax that may be levied and collected for payment of said bonds and all other bonds payable out of or secured by a pledge of said tax shall not exceed one-half of one per centum (1/2 of 1%) of the assessed valuation of taxable property in said county.

The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing, and authorization from or other action by the legislature shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of bonds hereunder or the levy of said special tax for payment thereof.

C. If a majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment shall vote for adoption of this amendment, then the approval of this amendment expressed by the said vote in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the special tax and in that event no additional election by the voters of Mobile county shall be required to authorize the levy of the special tax. If the majority vote at any election held hereunder is not in favor of the levy of the tax, or if at any such election the special tax shall be voted at a rate of less than three mills on each dollar of taxable property in Mobile county, then the governing body of Mobile county may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the levy of the special tax or on the increase of the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding three mills on each dollar of taxable property, and must call any such election within three months after the receipt by the said governing body of a petition for the calling of such election signed by not less than five percent of the qualified electors of Mobile county; provided, however, that not more than one election upon the levy of the special tax or upon the increase in the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding three mills as aforesaid, shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months.

If the special tax shall be discontinued or its rate reduced pursuant to any election held hereunder, its levy or an increase in its rate up to the aforesaid maximum of three mills may be authorized at a subsequent election or elections held hereunder, and the special tax may thereafter again be discontinued or reduced in rate pursuant to subsequent election or elections held hereunder, it being the intention hereof that the power of the governing body of Mobile county to call elections hereunder, and its duty to call them upon receipt of petition as herein provided, shall be continuous, subject only to the requirement that not more than one election may be held hereunder during any period of twelve consecutive months.

F. The rate of ad valorem taxation for general county purposes that is at the time otherwise permitted to Mobile county by the Constitution shall be reduced, for any tax year for which the special tax shall be levied, any such reduction to be by the same rate of millage at which the special tax shall be levied for the same tax year or by one mill on each dollar of taxable property in the county, whichever shall be the lesser reduction.

Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Tallapoosa county under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Tallapoosa county or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by the governing body of Baldwin county, such governing body may anticipate the proceeds therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, by issuing, without further election, interest bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax received by the county.

The governing body of Baldwin county shall have power to designate as the agency of the county, to construct, acquire, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities for said election precincts numbered one through seven any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county. When a public corporation shall have been so designated, the proceeds of said tax thereafter collected shall be paid to it and shall be used by it for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payments of the proceeds of said tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result in the impairment of the obligation of any contract theretofore made with respect to said tax. Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Baldwin county under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Baldwin county or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities shall be construed to be negotiable instruments notwithstanding the fact that they may be payable solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.

As used in this article, the term "election precincts" means the election precincts or beats of the county as they existed on July 27, 1965.

In the event the majority vote in said county on the adoption of this amendment is against the adoption hereof, or in the event the majority vote at any election held in said county pursuant to the provisions of this amendment after its adoption is not in favor of the issuance of the bonds proposed at such election, the governing body of said county may from time to time call other elections hereunder on the issuance of said bonds, but not more than one such election shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months.

The rent or rentals that the county or the said municipality may be obligated to pay under the terms of any lease between the said corporation and the said county or the said municipality shall not be considered in determining whether the county or the municipality has exceeded the debt limitation prescribed for the county or the municipality, as the case may be, by any provision of the Constitution of Alabama.

**Fire Protection or Garbage and Trash Disposal Districts in Jefferson County.**

The legislature may provide for the formation of districts in Jefferson county, Alabama, for establishing and maintaining a system for fighting or preventing fires or for the collection and disposal of garbage and trash; provided, however, that no territory lying within the limits of a municipal corporation at the time of the establishment of any such district shall be included within such district; and, provided further, that no such district shall be established unless the establishment thereof has been first approved by the qualified electors residing within the proposed district at an election held as provided for by a law or laws adopted by the legislature. A district may be established for either or both of the aforesaid purposes. The legislature may provide for submitting to the qualified electors residing within the proposed district the question of whether the district shall be created to establish and maintain a firefighting and fire prevention system, or the question of whether the district shall be created to establish and maintain a garbage collection and garbage disposal system; and to provide that the two questions may be submitted separately at the same election.

The expenses of establishing and maintaining any such firefighting and fire prevention system or any such garbage collection and disposal system in a district, as the case may be, shall be paid for exclusively by the proceeds of a service charge, which shall be levied and collected in an amount sufficient to pay the said expenses.

No service charge shall be levied unless the same has been first approved at an election by the qualified electors residing within the district, or in the proposed district if the question of the levy of the service charge is submitted simultaneously with the question of whether the district shall be created.

Said service charges shall be levied upon and collected from the persons and property to whom and to which such services are available; and the service charge shall be a lien upon any such property.

The legislature may provide for the enlargement of a district by the addition of territory thereto, subject to the following conditions: (1) No territory lying within a municipal corporation at the time the additional territory is brought within the district shall be included; (2) no territory shall be added unless the qualified electors of the territory to be added have approved the inclusion of said territory within the district at an election held for that purpose within the territory proposed to be added; (3) no territory shall be added unless the majority of the electors residing within the territory proposed to be added have first approved at an election held within such territory every service charge in effect within the district at the time the said addition is proposed.

The legislature shall have the authority to adopt laws providing for the administration of the affairs of the district by the governing body of the county or by an agency of the county.

Each such election shall be ordered, held, canvassed and may be contested in the same manner as is or may be provided by the law applicable to the city of Birmingham for elections to authorize the issuance of municipal bonds. The ballots used at such election shall contain the words "For Special Ad Valorem Tax of fifty cents per One Hundred Dollars of Taxable Property" and "Against Special Ad Valorem Tax of fifty cents per One Hundred Dollars of Taxable Property." The voter shall record his choice, whether for or against the special ad valorem tax by placing a cross mark before or after the words expressing his choice. Voting machines shall be used in any such election to the extent required by law. In the event the authority to levy the special ad valorem tax is defeated, subsequent elections for the approval of such tax may nevertheless be held again but no election shall be held within one year of any previous such election. Once the authority to levy such tax has been approved no further election shall be required thereon.

Neither shall the county or the city issue any bonds under the authority of this amendment, except bonds issued to finance the acquisition of industrial sites, unless prior thereto or contemporaneously therewith the county or the city, as the case may be, has entered into a lease or other similar agreement, with respect to the project being financed by such bonds, providing for the payment to the county or the city, as the case may be, of net rentals sufficient to pay the principal of and the interest on such bonds at the respective maturities of such principal and interest, and any bonds issued hereunder shall be secured by a pledge of such rentals and may be secured by a foreclosable mortgage on such project and by a pledge of any other taxes and revenues which the county or the city, as the case may be, is authorized by law to pledge to the payment of its bonded indebtedness.

In the event that any such action is necessary to prevent or cure a default in payment of the principal of or the interest on any bonds issued under the authority of this amendment, the county or the city, as the case may be, is authorized to levy and collect ad valorem taxes, without limitation as to rate or amount, on the assessed value of all taxable property in the county or the city, as the case may be, but only so long as and only to such extent as necessary to prevent or cure any such default.

In carrying out the purposes of this amendment, neither Madison county nor the city of Huntsville shall be subject to the provisions of section 93 of the Constitution of Alabama, and the taxes which the county and the city are hereinabove authorized to levy and collect are in addition to all other taxes which the county and the city are authorized to levy and collect.

(1) To refund, or provide for the refunding of, any bonds, warrants, notes or other securities issued by it pursuant to the provisions of the 1950 amendment or pursuant to the provisions hereof (whether before, at or after the maturity of the securities being so refunded and whether or not all or any part of such securities are then subject to redemption) by the sale and issuance of refunding bonds, warrants, notes or other securities in a principal amount not in excess of the principal amount of securities being refunded plus any premium necessary to redeem or retire the securities being refunded and any interest accrued on, or to accrue to the date of payment or redemption of, such securities;

(2) In the event any of the securities being so refunded cannot, by their terms, be redeemed or otherwise retired simultaneously with the issuance of the refunding securities, to invest, until the earliest date on which such redemption or retirement can be effected, such portion of the principal proceeds from the sale of such refunding securities as may not then be used for redemption or retirement of the refunded securities, in any investments in which municipal sinking funds are authorized to be invested by the provisions of section 265 of Title 37 of the Code of Alabama of 1940, as it exists at the time of the adoption of this amendment;

(3) To issue bonds, warrants, notes or other securities for the combined purpose of so refunding any such securities and of acquiring, constructing, extending or improving any one or more industrial or manufacturing plants or properties within the corporate limits or the police jurisdiction of such municipality, in which case the provisions of the preceding subdivisions (1) and (2) of this amendment shall apply to those of such bonds, warrants, notes or other securities that are being issued for refunding purposes;

(6) In connection with the issuance of any securities by it hereunder, to reserve the right to issue additional such securities hereunder, on a parity with the securities then being issued, on such terms and conditions as shall be specified in the proceedings of its governing body or other documents under which such securities are being issued.

Any securities issued by a municipality pursuant to the provisions of this amendment may be issued on the full faith and credit of such municipality or may be limited as to the source of their payment, all as the governing body of such municipality may determine.

**Hospital Tax in Districts 1, 2 and 3 of Franklin County.**

In addition to any taxes now authorized or that may be hereafter authorized by the Constitution and laws of Alabama, the governing body of Franklin county shall levy and cause to be collected annually a special district tax, not exceeding 50 cents on each 100 dollars assessed valuation of taxable property in districts one, two, and three of Franklin county, Alabama, to be used exclusively for public hospital purposes (as the term "public hospital purposes" is defined in amendment LXXVI [76] to the Constitution proposed by Acts of 1949, page 897, submitted December 13, 1949, and proclaimed ratified December 21, 1949) within said districts one, two, and three; provided that the time during which such tax is to continue and the purpose thereof shall have been first submitted to a vote of the qualified electors in districts one, two, and three of Franklin county and voted for by a majority of such electors voting at such election. The governing body of Franklin county may call an election at any time, and it shall be the duty of such governing body to call an election to be held within ninety days after receipt by it of a petition signed by not less than 5% of the qualified electors of said districts one, two, and three, requesting that such election be called. The governing body may call such election to be held at the same time that this amendment is submitted to the electors of the state for ratification and such election shall be effective to require the levy and collection of such tax in the event that this amendment shall be ratified. The notice of such election, ballots to be used at such election and procedures for holding and determining the results of such election shall be prescribed by the governing body of Franklin county. No election shall be held hereunder within one year from the date of the last election so held.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by the governing body of Franklin county, such governing body may anticipate the proceeds therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, by issuing, without further election, interest-bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax received by the county.

The governing body of Franklin county shall have power to designate as the agency of the county, to construct, acquire, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities for said districts one, two, and three, any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county. When a public corporation shall have been so designated, the proceeds of said tax thereafter collected shall be paid to it and shall be used by it for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payments of the proceeds of said tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result in the impairment of the obligation of any contract theretofore made with respect to said tax. Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Franklin county under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Franklin county or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities shall be construed to be negotiable instruments notwithstanding the fact that they may be payable solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.

Districts one, two, and three of Franklin county herein referred to are the commissioners districts one, two, and three now established in Franklin county as authorized by law.

## Amendment 263

1. To purchase, construct, lease, or otherwise acquire real property, plants, buildings, factories, works, facilities, machinery and equipment of any kind.

Such obligations or evidences of indebtedness may (in addition to any pledge or pledges authorized by subdivision 8 of this amendment) be issued upon the full faith and credit of the municipality or may be limited as to the source of their payment.

7. To levy and collect annually, in addition to all other taxes now authorized or permitted, a special tax or taxes of not exceeding two percent on the value of all taxable property therein as determined for state taxation, in the same manner as other county or municipal taxes are levied and collected.

8.

The recital in any bonds, warrants, notes or other obligations or evidences of indebtedness that they were issued pursuant to this amendment or that they were issued to provide funds to be used in furtherance of any power or authority herein authorized or that any special tax herein authorized has been pledged to the payment thereof shall be conclusive; no purchaser or holder thereof need inquire further; and the levy and collection of such tax shall continue until the principal of and interest on such obligations or evidences of indebtedness shall have been paid in full. The bonds, warrants, notes or other obligations or evidences of indebtedness issued hereunder shall not be considered an indebtedness of any municipality in Geneva county for the purpose of determining the borrowing capacity of such municipality under sections 224 and 225 of the Constitution; and the taxes herein authorized shall be in addition to those provided for or permitted in sections 215 and 216 of the Constitution and all amendments thereto.

This amendment shall be self-executing; but the legislature shall have the right and power by general, special or local act to adopt laws supplemental to this amendment or in furtherance of the purposes and objectives hereinabove set forth.

No municipality in Geneva county shall make any engagement or commitment or undertake any project under the provisions hereof unless and until the proposition has been approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the locality affected thereby who vote thereon at a referendum election held for such purpose. The governing body of any municipality may provide for holding such election, but in no case shall an election be held until notice of the election and of the proposition to be voted on has been published once a week for at least three successive weeks before the election in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.

## Amendment 264
**Bonds for Courthouse in Marengo County.**

Marengo county is hereby authorized to incur indebtedness to the extent of not exceeding $400,000 in aggregate principal amount, and to issue its bonds in evidence of the indebtedness so incurred, for the purpose of constructing and equipping a new courthouse in said county. Said bonds may be issued only after the question of the issuance thereof shall have been submitted to the qualified electors of said county at an election called for that purpose by the governing body of said county and a majority of said qualified electors voting at said election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of said bonds, which election shall be called, held, conducted, canvassed and may be contested in the manner provided by the then existing laws of Alabama with respect to elections on the issuance of bonds by counties; provided however, that if a majority of the qualified electors of said county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment shall vote for the adoption thereof then the approval of this amendment expressed by the vote in said county in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the issuance of the bonds, and in that event no additional election by the electors of said county shall be required to authorize the issuance of said bonds. In the event the majority vote in said county on the adoption of this amendment is against the adoption thereof, or in the event the majority vote at any election held in said county pursuant to the provisions of this amendment after its adoption is not in favor of the issuance of the bonds proposed at such election, the governing body of the said county may from time to time call other elections hereunder on the issuance of said bonds, but not more than one such election shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months. The power to become indebted and to issue bonds in evidence of such indebtedness shall be in addition to all other powers which the said county may have under the Constitution and laws of Alabama, and any bonds issued pursuant to this amendment shall not be chargeable against the amount of indebtedness which said county may incur under the Constitution and laws of Alabama in effect prior to the adoption of this amendment. All bonds issued under this amendment shall be general obligations of the county secured by an irrevocable pledge of its full faith and credit, shall be issued in accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of the general laws of Alabama existing at the time of the sale of said bonds respecting the maturities, sale, execution and redemption of bonds by counties.

If the said bonds are authorized to be issued, either by a majority of the qualified electors of said county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment voting for the adoption thereof or by a majority of the qualified electors of said county voting in favor of the issuance of said bonds at a separate county bond election on the question of the issuance of said bonds, and if the said bonds or any part thereof are actually issued, the governing body of said county shall thereafter have the power, without any further election, to agree to levy and collect, and to levy and collect, for a period of not exceeding seven years and for the sole purpose of paying the principal and interest on such bonds and creating a reserve therefor, a special additional annual ad valorem tax of not exceeding two mills on each dollar's worth of taxable property in said county, as assessed for state taxation for the preceding tax year. The said county shall not, however, in any event have the power to levy said tax or any part thereof with respect to any tax year beginning after final payment and retirement of said bonds. The term "taxable property" as used in this amendment shall include any property that has heretofore been or may hereafter be exempted from county taxes pursuant to the provisions of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of Title 51 of the Code of Alabama of 1940, as amended, or other similar statute, and the tax herein provided for, if authorized, levied and collected, shall be levied on and collected with respect to all such property just as if it had not been exempted from county taxes. Any provision of section 71 of Title 51 of the Code of Alabama of 1940 to the contrary notwithstanding, the tax herein provided for may, if authorized to be levied, be levied by the governing body of the county at any time prior to the September 1 next preceding the date on which such tax is to become due and payable.

The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing.

## Amendment 265

The state of Alabama is authorized to become indebted and to sell and issue interest-bearing bonds, in addition to all other bonds of the state, in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $15,000,000. The proceeds derived from the sale of said bonds shall be used solely for the purpose of paying the expenses incurred in the sale and issuance thereof and for the acquisition, construction and improvement of mental health facilities, including (a) improvements to the existing state hospitals for the mentally ill known as Bryce and Searcy hospitals and to the existing state facilities for treatment and care of the mentally retarded known as Partlow School, for which improvements not exceeding $3,000,000 of the proceeds from the said bonds may be used, (b) acquisition by construction and otherwise of one or more new state facilities and regional centers, or either, for treatment and care of the mentally retarded, for which purpose not exceeding $9,000,000 of the proceeds from the said bonds may be used, and (c) acquisition by construction and otherwise of regional and community-based mental health centers and regional and community-based centers for treatment and care of the mentally retarded, for which purpose not exceeding $3,000,000 of the proceeds from the said bonds may be used; provided, that bond proceeds may be used for a center referred to in the foregoing clause (c) only if a portion of the cost of that center is to be paid out of funds supplied by federal grant or by contribution of local political subdivisions or other local sources, or by both federal grant and such contribution. The improvement of a facility shall be deemed to include the renovation, modernization, remodeling, and equipment thereof and the construction of additions thereto; and the construction of a facility shall be deemed to include the acquisition of real estate sites and equipment therefor. Said bonds shall be sold only at a duly advertised public sale or sales, upon sealed bids or at auction, to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest net interest cost to the state for the bonds offered for sale, and shall be sold at not less than their face value plus accrued interest thereon. Said bonds shall be direct general obligations of the state and for the prompt and faithful payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon the full faith and credit of the state are hereby irrevocably pledged. In addition thereto, there is hereby specially and irrevocably pledged for payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds, pro rata and without priority of one bond over another by reason of prior issuance or otherwise, that portion of an additional privilege and license tax on the sale, storage, use, consumption, or delivery of cigarettes, levied by an act adopted at the 1967 regular session of the legislature of Alabama, that was appropriated in the said act to the purpose of acquiring and constructing mental health facilities in the state. The said special pledge shall create a charge on the tax proceeds herein specially pledged prior to all other charges or expenses for any purpose. The bonds issued under this amendment and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation in the state. The legislature shall adopt appropriate enabling legislation to carry out the intent and purpose of this amendment.

## Amendment 267

The governor, the director of finance, and the director of conservation are hereby constituted a bond commission with full authority, except as herein specified or limited, to provide the terms of the bonds and to provide for the sale and issuance thereof. The governor shall be the chairman of the commission, which shall meet at his call; its proceedings shall be signed by its members and filed with the secretary of state. The bonds may be sold, executed and delivered at any time and from time to time, may be in such forms, denominations, series and numbers, may be of such tenor and maturities, may bear such date or dates, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, with rights of conversion into another form, may be payable in such installments and at such place or places, may bear interest at such rate or rates, payable and evidenced in such manner, and may contain provisions for redemption at the option of the state at such date or dates prior to their maturity and upon payment of such redemption price or prices, all as shall be provided by the said commission in the order or orders under which the bonds are issued. The principal of each series of bonds shall mature in annual installments in such amounts as shall be specified in the authorizing order or orders; provided, that the first such installment shall mature not later than one year after the date of the bonds of such series, and the last such installment shall mature not later than twenty years after the date of the bonds of the same series; and provided further, that at the time of the issuance of each series of bonds, the maturities of the bonds of that series shall, to such extent as may be practicable, be so arranged that during each then succeeding fiscal year of the state the aggregate installments of principal and interest that will mature on all bonds that will be outstanding hereunder, immediately following the issuance of the bonds of that series, will be substantially equal. The determination by the commission that the requirements of the last proviso of the preceding sentence have been complied with shall be conclusive of such compliance.

The bonds shall be signed in the name of the state by the governor and countersigned by the director of finance and the great seal of the state of Alabama or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and shall be attested by the signature of the secretary of state; provided, that the facsimile signatures of any one or any two (but not all) of said officers may be reproduced on any of such bonds in lieu of being manually signed thereon.

"Special tax" means the annual ad valorem tax at the rate of  1/2 of 1 per centum (equivalent to 5 mills on each dollar) of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the county authorized to be levied by the county by the amendment known as amendment XVIII [18] to the Constitution of Alabama, as amended by the amendment to the Constitution known as amendment CLII [152], and also provided for in the amendments to the Constitution known as amendments C [100], CXXII [122], CLI [151], CXCIII [193], and CXCV [195].

Section B. Mobile county is hereby authorized to issue from time to time its bonds, not exceeding $3,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, of which $1,000,000 in principal amount shall be issued for the purpose of acquiring, providing, constructing and equipping a building for use as a juvenile detention home for the county in conjunction with the juvenile court of the county, and $2,000,000 in principal amount shall be issued for the purpose of acquiring, providing, constructing and equipping additions and improvements to the county courthouse building in the county; provided, that if all of the proceeds from the bonds issued for either of the said purposes shall not be needed for the purpose for which they were issued then the balance not so needed may in the sound judgment of the governing body of the county be expended for the said other purpose. The aggregate principal amount of all bonds at any time issued under this amendment, when added to the aggregate principal amount of all then outstanding bonds theretofore issued by the county under any other amendment to the Constitution of Alabama that are payable from or secured by the special tax shall not exceed 6 1/2 per centum of the assessed valuation of the taxable property situated in the county as assessed for state taxation for the state tax year next preceding that during which any bonds herein authorized shall be issued.

No bonds may be issued under the authority of this amendment until after the question of the issuance of such bonds shall have been submitted to the qualified electors of the county at any election called for that purpose by the governing body of the county and a majority of the said qualified electors voting at the said election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds; provided, that if a majority of the qualified electors of the county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment shall vote for the adoption thereof, then the approval of this amendment expressed by the said vote in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the issuance of the bonds provided for in this amendment and no additional election by the electors of the county shall be required to authorize the issuance of the said bonds. If the majority of the qualified electors of the county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment should not vote in favor of the adoption of this amendment, or if the majority of the qualified electors of the county voting at any election called by the governing body of the county under the provisions of this amendment should not vote in favor of the issuance of the bonds proposed at an election so called, the governing body of the county may from time to time call other elections hereunder on the issuance of such bonds, but not more than one such election shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months. Any such election called by the governing body of the county shall be called, held, conducted and canvassed, and may be contested, in the manner and within the time provided by the then existing general laws of Alabama pertaining to elections on the issuance of bonds by counties.

The bonds issued hereunder shall be general obligations of the county for the payment of the principal of and interest on which the full faith and credit of the county shall be irrevocably pledged, and in addition thereto there shall be irrevocably pledged for payment of the said principal and interest so much of the special tax as may be necessary to pay the said principal and interest at their respective maturities, each such pledge to be on a parity with all valid pledges of the special tax at any time heretofore or hereafter made, to such extent as shall not impair the obligation of any then existing valid prior pledges.

The principal of each series of bonds issued under this amendment shall mature in annual installments, the first of which installments shall mature not later than three (3) years after the date of the bonds of that series and the last of which shall mature not later than thirty (30) years after the date of the bonds of that series; provided, that the maturities of each series of bonds issued under this amendment shall be arranged so that (a) no annual installment of principal of the bonds of such series maturing during any fiscal year of the county shall be more than four times as great as the smallest installment of principal of the same series maturing during any prior fiscal year, and (b) the aggregate amount of principal and interest that will mature in any one fiscal year with respect to that series of bonds, and also all other bonds theretofore issued by the county and then outstanding that are payable out of or secured by a pledge of the special tax, shall not exceed the amount of the proceeds collected from the special tax during the then next preceding tax year. Except as herein otherwise provided, all bonds issued under this amendment shall be issued in accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of the general laws of Alabama existing at the time of the issuance of such bonds respecting the sale, execution, issuance and redemption of bonds by counties. The indebtedness evidenced by the bonds issued under this amendment or under any other amendment to the Constitution which are payable out of or are secured by a pledge of the special tax shall be in addition to and shall not be charged against the limitation on the indebtedness of the county provided for in section 224 of the Constitution.

So long as the principal of or interest on any of the bonds issued under this amendment remains unpaid, the governing body of Mobile county shall continue the levy of the special tax at such rate as may be sufficient to pay the said principal and interest at their respective maturities; provided, that the total rate of the special tax that may be levied and collected for payment of the said bonds and all other bonds payable out of or secured by a pledge of the special tax shall not exceed 4 1/2 mills on each dollar of the assessed valuation of all properties subject to taxation by the county as assessed for state taxation and that the said rate of 4 1/2 mills on each dollar of the said assessed valuation shall be reduced for each tax year for which the special hospital tax authorized in paragraph G of the amendment to the Constitution known as amendment No. CXCV [195] shall have been levied at a rate exceeding 1 mill on each dollar of the taxable property in the county, any such reduction to be by  1/2 mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the county or by rate of millage equal to the rate by which the said special hospital tax levied for that tax year exceeds one mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation of such taxable property, whichever shall be the lesser reduction. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable, however, only to such extent as shall not impair the obligation of any pledges of the special tax heretofore made for the benefit of any bonds issued by the county prior to the adoption of this amendment.

The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing, and authorization from or other action by the legislature shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of bonds hereunder or the levy of the special tax for payment thereof.

"Presiding master" means a master so designated by the supreme court or in the absence of such designation, the judge first named in the order appointing masters. "Shall" is mandatory and "may" is permissive.

2. A judicial commission is hereby created which shall be authorized to investigate, conduct hearings on the qualifications of judges and make recommendations to the supreme court in regard to the retirement, censure, suspension or removal of such judges. The commission shall consist of: one judge of the court of appeals to be appointed by the supreme court; two judges of circuit courts to be appointed by the circuit judges association; one probate judge to be appointed by the probate judges association; one judge of a municipal court to be appointed by the supreme court; two practicing attorneys who shall be members in good standing of the state bar who shall have practiced law in this state for at least ten years and who shall be appointed by the board of commissioners of the state bar, and two citizens neither of whom shall be a judge, active or retired, nor a member of the state bar, and who shall be appointed by the governor subject to the approval of the Alabama senate. The terms of these members shall be for six years. Of the initial appointees, three (a circuit judge, the judge of the court of appeals and a citizen) shall be appointed for six years; three members (the municipal court judge, the probate judge and a practicing attorney) shall be appointed for four years; and three members (a circuit judge, a practicing attorney and a citizen) shall be appointed for three years.

No act of the commission shall be valid unless concurred in by a majority of its members. The commission shall select one of its members to serve as chairman.

3. A judge, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section, may be censured, suspended, or removed for action occurring not more than six years prior to the commencement to his current term that constitutes willful misconduct in office, willful and persistent failure to perform his duties, habitual intemperance, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or he may be retired for disability that seriously interferes with the performance of his duties and is or is likely to become permanent. The judicial commission may, after such investigation as the commission deems necessary, order a hearing to be held before it concerning the censure, suspension, removal or retirement of a judge, or the commission may in its discretion request the supreme court to appoint three special masters, who shall be justices or judges of courts of record, to hear and take evidence in any such matter, and to report thereon to the commission. If, after hearing, or after considering the record and report of the masters, the commission finds good cause therefor, it shall recommend to the supreme court the censure, suspension, removal or retirement, as the case may be, of the judge.

The supreme court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and in its discretion may permit the introduction of additional evidence and shall order censure, suspension, removal or retirement, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject the recommendation.

If the majority vote at any election held hereunder is not in favor of the levy of the tax, or if at any such election the special tax shall be voted at a rate of less than forty-five cents on each one hundred dollars worth of taxable property, then the governing body of the county or city, as the case may be, may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the levy of the special tax or on the increase of the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding a total amount of forty-five cents on each one hundred dollars of taxable property, and must call any such election at the next general or special countywide election or next municipal election, as the case may be, next following the receipt of a petition in the manner and form herein prescribed.

If the majority of electors participating in the election vote in favor of the discontinuance or reduction in the rate of the tax, as the case may be, such discontinuance or reduction shall become effective for the tax year next succeeding the tax year in which such election is held. Provided, that not more than one election for the discontinuance or reduction in the rate of the special tax shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months. All such elections shall be called, held and conducted in the same manner as are elections proposing the special tax.

## Amendment 371
**Fire Protection in Limestone County.**

The Limestone county governing body is authorized in its discretion to establish fire districts within the geographical boundaries of Limestone county, said districts to exclude any corporate municipality which does not request through resolution of its governing body to be made a part of and subject to the provisions of this amendment. The county governing body, in its discretion, may establish, in lieu of or in addition to said fire districts, a county fire department to furnish county-wide fire protection.

The governing body may name a fire marshal for Limestone county, whose principal duty shall be the coordination of fire protection within the county including all fire departments and fire stations, either in the district or county, and their full-time and part-time employees. Upon the request of the county governing body the fire marshal shall submit a budget for the county fire department and shall perform such other tasks related to fire protection as may, from time to time, be assigned to him by the county governing body.

The governing body is hereby authorized to fix a county fire protection tax, which tax shall become effective upon the approval of a majority of electors within any particular fire district or other area of the county where the tax is to be levied. The tax fixed by the governing body shall be based upon the value of real and personal property assessed by affected property owners, as shown on the records of the tax assessor of Limestone county, Alabama, and shall be assessed and collected as are all ad valorem taxes in the county. The amount collected each year from assessment of this fire protection tax shall be paid into the county general fund and used in furtherance of fire protection within the affected area.

The county governing body is hereby authorized upon approval by resolution adopted by said governing body to adopt, amend and repeal regulations for the safeguarding of life and property from the hazards of fire and explosion in the county, which shall be known as the Limestone County Fire Protection Code. Such regulations shall have the force and effect of law and any violation thereof may, within the discretion of the county governing body, constitute a Class A misdemeanor, as defined in Act No. 607, S. 33 of the 1977 Regular Session (Acts 1977, p. 812), and upon conviction thereof may be punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail, not to exceed one year, or both fine and imprisonment. Said code shall be effective in all unincorporated areas of the county and in those incorporated areas which choose to come under the provisions of this act.

The county governing body is hereby authorized to employ or to authorize the employment of a fire marshal, fire inspectors, firemen, secretarial and clerical employees and any other employees which it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this act and it is further authorized to make such expenditures for salaries, equipment, property (whether real, personal or mixed), or other expenses related to fire protection which it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this amendment.

The legislature may provide for or amend, from time to time, any laws pertaining to fire districts in Limestone county.

## Amendment 372
**Compensation of County Officers and Restructuring or Abolition of Certain Offices in Geneva County.**

The legislature may, from time to time, by general or local laws applicable to or operative in Geneva county, fix, regulate and alter fees, commissions, allowances and salaries, including the method and basis of the compensation to be charged or received by all of the county officers of Geneva county; and may place any or all of such officers on a salary and provide for the fees, commissions, allowances and percentages collectible by such officers to be paid into the treasury from which their salaries are paid.

The legislature may from time to time, by general or local law, provide for the transfer of the duties of the tax assessor and tax collector of Geneva county to another officer of such county; or provide for the abolition of the said offices left without duties, or create a completely new office in such county and transfer to such office the duties of each of the said tax offices of tax assessor and tax collector in such county; provided, that the officer to fill the newly created office will be compensated for the performance of the duties of said office by a salary fixed according to law.

In the event this amendment is approved and a majority of the qualified electors of Geneva county who vote thereon vote in favor of the adoption of this amendment when it is submitted, then any law theretofore passed which places any such officers in Geneva county on a salary basis, or any law fixing, regulating and altering the costs and charges of court and the fees, commissions, allowances and salaries of any such officer in Geneva county, may become effective without any other election having been held thereon. In the event this amendment is approved and a majority of the qualified electors of said county who vote thereon vote against its approval, then such act or acts shall have no further force or effect.

## Amendment 373

(a) On and after October 1, 1978, all taxable property within this state, not exempt by law, shall be divided into the following classes for the purposes of ad valorem taxation:

Class I. All property of utilities used in the business of such utilities.

Class II. All property not otherwise classified.

Class III. All agricultural, forest and single-family owner-occupied residential property, and historic buildings and sites.

Class IV. All private passenger automobiles and motor trucks of the type commonly known as "pickups" or "pickup trucks" owned and operated by an individual for personal or private use and not for hire, rent or compensation.

(b) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by the state, all taxable property shall be forever taxed at the same rate. On and after October 1, 1978, such property shall be assessed for ad valorem tax purposes according to the classes thereof as herein defined at the following ratios of assessed value to the fair and reasonable market value (except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) hereof) of such property:

Class I. 30 per centum.

Class II. 20 per centum.

Class III. 10 per centum.

Class IV. 15 per centum.

(c) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by counties, municipalities or other taxing authorities, all taxable property shall be forever taxed at the same rate. On and after October 1, 1978, such property shall be assessed for ad valorem tax purposes according to the classes of property defined in subsection (a) hereof and at the same ratios of assessed value to the fair and reasonable market value thereof as fixed in subsection (b) hereof, except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) hereof and this subsection (such ratios being herein called "assessment ratios"). In connection with the ad valorem taxes that a county, municipality or other taxing authority is authorized or required to levy and collect pursuant to any provision of this Constitution, for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, any such taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature, by resolution of the governing body of that taxing authority, at any time not later than September 30, 1979, increase or decrease the assessment ratio applicable to any class of taxable property, such increase or decrease to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1978. If (1) a county, municipality or other taxing authority adjusts an assessment ratio pursuant to the preceding sentence and (2) the receipts from all ad valorem taxes levied by or with respect to such taxing authority during the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, exceed by more than five percent, or are less than 95 percent of, the receipts from such ad valorem taxes for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, then at any time not later than September 30, 1980, for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1979, the taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature, by resolution of the governing body of that taxing authority, adjust any assessment ratio applicable to any class of taxable property. On and after October 1, 1979, the governing body of any county, municipality or other taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature, at any time increase or decrease the assessment ratio applicable to any class of taxable property; provided, that any proposed adjustment to an assessment ratio to be made pursuant to this sentence, whether an increase or a decrease, shall have been (1) proposed by the governing body of the taxing authority after a public hearing on such proposal, (2) thereafter approved by an act of the legislature, and (3) subsequently approved by a majority vote of the qualified electors residing in the taxing authority who vote on the proposal at a special election called and held in accordance with the law governing special elections. No decrease in an assessment ratio pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be permitted with respect to either of the ad valorem tax years beginning October 1, 1978, and October 1, 1979, if such county, municipality or other taxing authority has increased any millage rate under subsection (e) of this section with respect to such ad valorem tax year. The legislature shall enact general laws applicable to all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities regulating and establishing criteria for the exercise of the powers granted such taxing authorities to adjust assessment ratios as hereinabove provided. Such assessment ratios as herein authorized may vary among taxing authorities so long as each such assessment ratio is uniform within a taxing authority. Any decrease in any assessment ratio pursuant to this subsection shall not jeopardize the payment of any bonded indebtedness secured by any tax levied by the taxing authority decreasing the assessment ratio. Any action authorized by this subsection to be taken by a taxing authority, or the governing body thereof, shall, other than in the case of a municipality, be taken by resolution of the governing body of the county in which such taxing authority is located acting on behalf of such taxing authority.

(d) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by the state or by any county, municipality or other taxing authority, no class of taxable property shall have an assessment ratio of less than five per centum nor more than 35 per centum.

(e) A county, municipality or other taxing authority may decrease any ad valorem tax rate at any time, provided such decrease shall not jeopardize the payment of any bonded indebtedness secured by such tax. For the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, when the tax assessor of each county shall complete the assembly of the assessment book for his county for that ad valorem tax year and the computation of ad valorem taxes that will be paid upon such assessment, he shall certify to each authority within his county that levies an ad valorem tax the amount of ad valorem tax that will be produced by every levy in that ad valorem tax year but excluding for this purpose any assessment of new taxable property not previously subject to taxation (except "escaped" property as defined by law) added to the tax rolls of such county for the ad valorem tax year in which such certification is made that was not included on the tax rolls for the next preceding ad valorem tax year. Any county, municipality or other taxing authority, at any time not later than September 30, 1979, may increase the rate at which any ad valorem tax is levied by or with respect to that taxing authority above the limit otherwise provided in this Constitution, provided that the amount of the above-described certification of anticipated tax receipts with respect to such tax is less than 120 percent of the actual receipts from such tax for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, such increase to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1978; provided, that any such millage increase shall not exceed in mills the total of (i) the number of additional mills that is necessary, when added to the millage rate imposed with respect to such tax on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, to produce revenue that is not less than and that is substantially equal to that received by the taxing authority with respect to such tax during such immediately preceding ad valorem tax year, plus (ii) a number of additional mills equal to 20 percent of the total mills imposed by that taxing authority with respect to such tax on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977. If, for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, the receipts from any ad valorem tax with respect to which any millage rate has been increased pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence are less than 95 percent of the receipts from such ad valorem tax for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, then at any time not later than September 30, 1980, the taxing authority may increase any millage rate with respect to such ad valorem tax in the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence, such increase to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1979. It is further provided that all millage adjustments shall be made in increments of not less than one tenth (1/10) mill.

(f) On and after October 1, 1979, any county, municipality or other taxing authority may at any time increase the rate at which any ad valorem tax is levied above the limit otherwise provided in this Constitution; provided, that the proposed increase to be made pursuant to this subsection shall have been (1) proposed by the governing body of the taxing authority after a public hearing on such proposal, (2) thereafter approved by an act of the legislature, and (3) subsequently approved by a majority vote of the qualified electors residing in the taxing authority who vote on the proposal at a special election called and held in accordance with the law governing special elections. Any adjustments or other actions authorized to be made or taken pursuant to this subsection and subsection (e) hereof shall be made or taken by resolution of the governing body of such taxing authority, or if there is no such governing body and in the case of a taxing authority other than a municipality, by resolution of the governing body of the county in which such taxing authority is located acting on behalf of such taxing authority. The provisions of subsections (c), (e) and (f) of this section shall not apply to ad valorem taxes levied by the state.

(g) The legislature is authorized to enact legislation to implement the provisions of this section and may provide for exemptions from taxation; provided, that unless otherwise expressly provided, no amendment to this section shall be construed to repeal any statutory exemption existing on the effective date of any such amendment hereto.

(h) Wherever any constitutional provision or statute provides for, limits or measures the power or authority of any county, municipality or other taxing authority to levy taxes, borrow money or incur indebtedness in relation to the assessment of property therein for state taxes or for state and county taxes, such provision shall mean as assessed for county or municipal taxes, as the case may be.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, including any amendment thereto whenever adopted with respect to taxable property located in the city of Mountain Brook, the city of Vestavia Hills, or the city of Huntsville, the amount of ad valorem taxes payable to the state and to all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities with respect to any item of taxable property described as Class I property shall never exceed 2 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, such amount with respect to any item of Class II property shall never exceed 1 1/2 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, such amount with respect to any item of Class IV property shall never exceed 1 1/4 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, and such amount with respect to any item of Class III property shall never exceed 1 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year. Whenever the total amount of ad valorem property taxes otherwise payable by any taxpayer with respect to any item of taxable property shall exceed in any one ad valorem tax year the maximum amount of such taxes permitted by this section, such amount of taxes shall be reduced by subtracting that amount of tax due that is in excess of the amount of tax otherwise permissible under the Constitution. In connection with the taxation of any item of taxable property, the amount of tax to be subtracted with respect to each authority levying and collecting any ad valorem property tax shall be in the same proportion to the total amount of tax to be subtracted that the total number of mills on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority levied by such taxing authority bears to the total number of mills on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority levied by all taxing authorities with respect to such item of taxable property. Before sending to any taxpayer any notice relating to the collection of ad valorem taxes, the tax collector in each county shall determine whether any portion of the amount of ad valorem property tax otherwise due with respect to any item of taxable property shall be subtracted pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and shall apportion the amount to be subtracted in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on and after October 1, 1978, taxable property defined in subsection (a) hereof as Class III property shall, upon application by the owner of such property, be assessed at the ratio of assessed value to the current use value of such taxable property and not the fair and reasonable market value of such property. The legislature may enact laws uniformly applicable to the state and all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities establishing criteria and procedures for the determination of the current use value of any eligible taxable property and procedures for qualifying such property for assessment at its current use value. The legislature may also enact laws uniformly applicable to the state and all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities providing for the ad valorem taxation of any taxable property ceasing to qualify for current use valuation; provided, however, that any additional tax on taxable property ceasing to qualify for current use valuation shall not apply to more than the three ad valorem tax years immediately preceding such cessation of qualification (including as one such year the year in which cessation of qualification occurs).

(k) The following property shall be exempt from all ad valorem taxation: the real and personal property of the state, counties and municipalities and property devoted exclusively to religious, educational or charitable purposes, household and kitchen furniture, all farm tractors, all farming implements when used exclusively in connection with agricultural property and all stocks of goods, wares and merchandise.

(l) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, with respect to the costs of reappraisal incident to the state-wide reappraisal of property heretofore authorized by the legislature, each county, municipality or other taxing authority for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1978, may impose and levy an additional ad valorem tax of not more than two mills on all taxable property located in the taxing authority in order to reimburse itself for its payment of such costs of reappraisal or to pay any unpaid costs or its pro rata share of such unpaid costs of reappraisal. The taxes provided for in this subsection, or any pro rata part thereof, shall terminate at the end of the ad valorem tax year in which sufficient funds are received from the taxes to pay in full the said reappraisal costs and any receipts from such taxes that are received during the ad valorem tax year of their termination that are not needed for the purposes specified herein may be used by the taxing authority levying the tax for general purposes of the taxing authority. The taxes authorized in this subsection shall not exceed in the aggregate, with respect to any item of taxable property located in the taxing authority, a total of two mills for all such taxes levied by all taxing authorities in a county and not two mills for each taxing authority in a county. If more than one such taxing authority in a county has paid or owes all or a portion of its reappraisal costs, such two mills shall be prorated among such taxing authorities in the county as they may agree, or if they cannot agree, in the percentage which each such taxing authority's costs of reappraisal bear to the total costs of reappraisal of all taxing authorities in the county. The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to the costs incurred by a taxing authority incident to the state-wide reappraisal of property heretofore authorized by the legislature, the amount of which costs shall be certified by the department of revenue, and shall not be applicable to any future reappraisals that may be required by law.

(m) If any portion of this section should be declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining portions of this section, which shall continue effective.

## Amendment 374
**Bonds for Penal and Correctional Facilities.**

The state of Alabama is authorized to become indebted and to sell and issue interest bearing bonds, in addition to all other bonds of the state, in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $15,000,000.00, the proceeds derived from the sale of said bonds to be used solely for the purpose of paying the expenses incurred in the sale and issuance thereof and for the acquisition, construction, equipment and improvement of state prisons, facilities for the housing, training, education or rehabilitation of prisoners, and other penal and correctional institutions and facilities (including sites therefor) necessary or useful in connection with such prisons and other facilities. None of the proceeds derived from the sale of said bonds may be used to pay rents for the use of real or personal property or to make payments under any lease with option to purchase or similar contractual arrangement. The state of Alabama is also authorized to become indebted and to sell and issue bonds to refund any of the bonds herein authorized, in the amounts (which may exceed the principal amount of the bonds being refunded) and manner as may be specified by the legislature. The bonds shall be sold only at a duly advertised public sale or sales, upon sealed bids or at auction, to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest total net interest cost to the state for the bonds offered for sale and shall be sold at not less than their face value plus accrued interest thereon. The bonds shall be direct general obligations of the state, and for the prompt and faithful payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon the full faith and credit of the state are hereby irrevocably pledged. The bonds issued under this amendment and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation in the state. The legislature shall enact appropriate enabling legislation to carry out the intent and purpose of this amendment.

## Amendment 375
**Amendment of Section 110.**

**"General laws," "special or private laws" and "local law" defined; general laws applicable to class of municipalities to define class on basis related to the law; legislature may classify municipalities; enactment of general laws applicable to only one municipality.**

A general law is a law which in its terms and effect applies either to the whole state, or to one or more municipalities of the state less than the whole in a class. A general law applicable to such a class of municipalities shall define the class on the basis of criteria reasonably related to the purpose of the law, provided that the legislature may also enact and change from time to time a general schedule of not more than eight classes of municipalities based on population according to any designated federal decennial census, and general laws for any purpose may thereafter be enacted for any such class. Any law heretofore enacted which complies with the provisions of this section shall be considered a general law.

No general law which at the time of its enactment applies to only one municipality of the state shall be enacted after January 1, 1979, unless notice of the intention to apply therefor shall have been given and shown as provided in section 106 of this Constitution for special, private or local laws; provided, that such notice shall not be deemed to constitute such law a local law.

A special or private law is one which applies to an individual, association or corporation. A local law is a law which is not a general law or a special or private law.

## Amendment 376
**Acquisition, Development, etc., of Industrial Parks by City of Anniston.**

Any provision of the Constitution or laws of the state of Alabama to the contrary notwithstanding, the governing body of the city of Anniston shall have full and continuing power and authority, to do any one or more of the following:

1. To acquire and develop one or more parcels of land as the site or sites for an industrial park or industrial parks; and to expend or grant public money and things of value for such acquisition and development.

Prior to making any sale of any property comprising all or part of an industrial park, said city shall cause appraisals of the market value of the property to be so sold to be made by at least two independent appraisers, and shall cause a copy of each such appraisal to be filed in the permanent records of said city. Each such appraisal shall be made not earlier than 180 days prior to the consummation of such sale. In any case where each appraisal obtained pursuant to the provisions hereof sets forth a different value, the average of the market values stated in the separate appraisals shall be deemed to constitute the reasonable market value of the property.

3. This amendment shall be self-executing; but the legislature shall have the right and power by general, special or local act to adopt laws supplemental to this amendment or in furtherance of the purposes and objectives hereinabove set forth.

4. Said city shall not make any engagement or commitment or undertake any project under the provisions hereof unless and until the proposition has been approved and recommended to the governing body of said city by a majority vote of all the members of the industrial development board of the city of Anniston, or its successor, at a duly convened meeting of said board, said approval and recommendation to be evidenced by a certified copy of a resolution duly passed and adopted by said board and delivered to the city clerk of said city and unless and until the governing body of said city passes and adopts an ordinance approving and authorizing such proposition. Provided, however, no ordinance shall be passed and adopted by the governing body of said city under the provisions hereof unless and until the proposed ordinance has been published at least once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published within said city, together with a notice stating the time and place that the ordinance is to be considered by said governing body and stating further at such time and place all persons who desire shall have an opportunity of being heard in favor of or in opposition to such ordinance.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Constitution to the contrary, the legislature may, by local law, provide for the election in 1978 to fill the office of tax assessor or tax collector, of Coffee county, or such other office created pursuant to this amendment. This authorization specifically includes, but it is not limited to, the power to suspend the general law relating to deadlines for filing qualifying documents and payment of fees, to set the terms of the offices named herein, and to prescribe the method of placing the names of the candidates on the ballot at the election.

Thereafter, unless otherwise provided by general or local law, the term of office of revenue commissioner of Coffee county shall be six years and until a successor is elected and qualified.

Unless otherwise provided by the legislature, the revenue commissioner of Coffee county shall be charged with the performance of any duty provided by law for the tax assessor and tax collector of Coffee county, and his compensation shall be fixed by the governing body of the county. Immediately upon the beginning of the first term of the office of revenue commissioner of Coffee county, the offices of tax assessor and tax collector shall be abolished. If either of the offices of tax assessor or tax collector of Coffee county should become vacant at any time from the effective date of this amendment until October 1, 1981, the remaining officer shall thereupon become the revenue commissioner of Coffee county and shall serve as such for the balance of the term for which he was elected, and the offices of tax assessor and tax collector of Coffee county shall be abolished. Should this event occur 30 days or more before the general election of 1978, then the office of revenue commissioner of Coffee county shall be filled at such election for a term of six years, and until a successor is elected and qualified and any person who has qualified to have his name placed upon the ballot as a candidate for either tax assessor or tax collector of Coffee county shall be entitled to have his name placed upon the ballot as a candidate for revenue commissioner of Coffee county.

The board shall have a membership of nine trustees consisting of the governor, the state treasurer, the director of finance (or such other official as may by law succeed to the responsibilities of the director of finance), two trustees appointed by the governor, two trustees appointed by the lieutenant governor, and two trustees appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives. The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance shall each serve as a trustee ex officio, and the service of each such official as a trustee shall begin and end concurrently with the beginning and end of his or her tenure in such office. As promptly as practicable after the effective date of this amendment, the other trustees shall be appointed for the following initial terms: The trustees to be appointed by the governor shall be appointed for terms beginning immediately upon their respective appointments and ending at noon on October 1 in the first and second calendar years, respectively, next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective; the trustees to be appointed by the lieutenant governor shall be appointed for a term beginning immediately upon his or her appointment and ending at noon on October 1 in the third calendar year next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective; and the trustees to be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives shall be appointed for a term beginning immediately upon his or her appointment and ending at noon on October 1 in the fourth calendar year next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective. Thereafter, the term of office of each appointed trustee shall be six years, commencing at noon on the October 1 on which the term of the immediate predecessor trustee shall end.

(b) If at any time there shall be a vacancy among the appointed trustees, a successor trustee shall be appointed to serve for the unexpired term applicable to such vacancy. The appointment of each appointed trustee (other than those initially appointed), whether for a full six-year term or to complete an unexpired term, shall be made by the same officer of the state who appointed the trustee whose term shall have expired or is to expire or in whose position on the board a vacancy otherwise exists and shall be made not earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such trustee is to take office as such. Each appointed trustee shall hold office from the effective date of his or her appointment until his or her confirmation or rejection by the senate as provided in subsection (c) of this section, and, if confirmed by the senate, until the expiration of the term (or portion thereof) for which he or she was appointed; provided that if the term of any trustee shall expire prior to the reappointment of such trustee or prior to the appointment of his or her successor, such trustee shall continue to serve until his or her successor is appointed, and if such trustee is reappointed for a new term after the expiration of the immediately preceding term which he or she has been serving, his or her new term of office shall be deemed to have commenced at noon on the October 1 on which the immediately preceding term shall have expired. Trustees shall be eligible for reappointment without limit as to the number of terms previously served.

(c) At the beginning of every regular session of the legislature the governor shall certify to the senate the names of all who shall have been appointed as trustees since the commencement of the last regular session of the legislature, and the senate shall confirm or reject each of them as it shall determine to be in the best interests of the state. If the senate takes no action during such regular session with respect to any trustee whose appointment was so certified, such trustee shall be deemed to have been confirmed by the senate. If the senate rejects the appointment of any trustee, such rejection shall immediately terminate the service of such trustee and the resulting vacancy in the membership of the board shall be filled by a subsequent appointment made in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. Trustees appointed during a regular session of the legislature shall not be subject to confirmation or rejection by the senate until the regular session of the legislature next succeeding their appointment.

(d) Each appointed trustee shall, at the time of his or her appointment and at all times during his or her term of office, be a qualified elector of the state, and a failure by any trustee to remain so qualified during such term shall cause a vacancy of the office of such trustee. Each appointed trustee shall have recognized competence and experience in the evaluation and management of investments. No person holding a full-time office or position of employment with the United States of America, the state, any county or municipality in the state, or any instrumentality, agency or subdivision of any of the foregoing, shall be eligible for appointment as a trustee. Any person who is an appointed trustee shall be deemed to vacate his or her office as such trustee by the acceptance of any office or employment which, had such person held such office or been so employed at the time of his or her appointment as a trustee, would have rendered such person ineligible for appointment as a trustee. Service by any person as a member, director, trustee or other participant in the management or administration of any governmental agency, board or commission, or public educational institution, or other public body of the United States of America, the state, or any county or municipality or other political subdivision shall not render such person ineligible for appointment as a trustee unless such service constitutes full-time employment. Any appointed trustee may be impeached and removed from office as a trustee in the same manner and on the same grounds provided in Section 174 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or successor provision thereof, and the general laws of the state for impeachment and removal of the officers of the state subject to said Section 174 or successor provision thereof. The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance may not be impeached and removed from office as a trustee apart from their impeachment and removal from the respective offices by virtue of which, ex officio, they serve as trustees.

(e) The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance shall perform the duties of trustees, ex officio, without any compensation other than that to which they are respectively entitled as governor, state treasurer and director of finance. Appointed trustees shall be entitled to such compensation for their services as may from time to time be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature, but the power to provide compensation of appointed trustees shall be discretionary with the legislature and nothing in this amendment shall be construed to confer upon such trustees an absolute right to any compensation for their services. Each appointed trustee shall be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred in the performance of his or her duties as a trustee.

(f) A majority of the trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the board, and decisions shall be made on the basis of a majority of the quorum then present and voting, with each trustee to have a single vote. No vacancy in the membership of the board or the voluntary disqualification or abstention of any trustee shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all of the powers and duties of the board. The governor shall be the chairman and presiding officer of the board, and the board may appoint such other officers to perform such duties, not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment or applicable law, as the board shall deem necessary or appropriate. In addition to such regular meetings of the board as may be provided by law or by bylaws or rules duly adopted by the board, special meetings of the board may be called by the governor acting alone or by any three other trustees acting in concert, in each case upon two days' notice to each trustee given in person or by registered letter or telegram; provided, however, that such notice to each trustee may be waived by such trustee, either before or after the meeting with respect to which such notice would otherwise be required. Any meeting held by the board for any purpose shall be open to the public, except that executive or secret sessions may be held by the board when the character or good name of a person is involved. All proceedings of the board shall be reduced to writing on behalf of the board and maintained in the permanent records of the board, a copy of which shall be filed in the principal office of the board and shall be open for public inspection there during regular business hours. The principal office of the board shall be the principal office of the director of finance.

(g) No trustee shall vote on or participate in the discussion or consideration of any matter coming before the board in which such trustee, personally or through family connections or business associations, has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including, but without limitation thereto, decisions of the board concerning the investment of moneys constituting part of the trust fund in any deposit or obligation of any bank or corporation in which such trustee may have such an interest. If there shall be brought before the board any matter in which a trustee shall have any interest which may conflict with his duties as a trustee, he or she shall immediately make a complete disclosure to the board of such interest and shall thereafter withdraw from participation in any deliberation and decision of the board with respect to such matter.

(h) The board shall have all of the powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this amendment, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following powers:

(1) To adopt, alter and repeal bylaws, regulations and rules for the regulation and conduct of its affairs and business;

(2) To make, enter into and execute contracts, agreements and other instruments and to take such other actions as may be necessary or convenient to accomplish any purpose for which the trust fund was created or to exercise any power expressly, or by reasonable implication, granted by this amendment;

(3) To enter into contracts with, to accept aid and grants from, to cooperate with and to do any and all things that may be necessary in order to avail itself of the aid and cooperation of the United States of America, the state or any agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of either thereof in furtherance of the purposes of this amendment; and

(4) To appoint, employ and contract with such employees, agents, advisors and consultants, including, but not limited to, attorneys, accountants, financial experts and such other advisors, consultants and agents as may in its judgment be necessary or desirable, and to fix their compensation;

provided, however, that any obligation created or assumed by the board shall not create any pecuniary obligation or liability of the state or the trust fund other than such as shall be payable out of moneys appropriated by the legislature to defray the expenses of the board in carrying out the purposes of this amendment. No lien or charge against any assets of the trust fund for any purpose whatsoever shall be created by or result from any law enacted by the legislature or any action taken by the board or any other department, agency or instrumentality of the state.

(i) The expenses of making and disposing of investments such as brokerage commissions, legal expenses referable to a particular transaction, transfer taxes and other customary transactional expenses shall, as provided in Section 5(c) of this amendment, be payable from the investment income of the trust fund, but no administrative or other expenses not specifically required to make or dispose of a particular investment shall be payable out of any assets of the trust fund. The legislature shall provide for the administrative and other necessary expenses of the board in the same manner as it provides for the expenses of operating other departments and agencies of the state.

Section 4. Sources of Trust Capital.  (a) There shall be transferred from the general fund of the state into the trust fund, as the initial trust capital, moneys in an amount equal to the sum of (i) all proceeds of any oil and gas capital payments received by the state at any time after January 1, 1981, and on or before November 1, 1981, and (ii) all income or profit derived from the investment and reinvestment of the proceeds of such oil and gas capital payments (including income or profit derived from the investment and reinvestment of previously derived income or profit) prior to the transfer of such proceeds into the trust fund, less and except the following:

(1) Any amount of such proceeds, income or profit which has been disbursed by the state, prior to the effective date of this amendment, for the use of the board of corrections pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 81-764 enacted at the 1981 Regular Session of the legislature;

(2) Any amount of such proceeds, income or profit which has been disbursed by the state, prior to the effective date of this amendment, for the use of the department of mental health pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 81-770 enacted at the 1981 Regular Session of the legislature;

(3) Any amount of such proceeds, income or profit which has been appropriated by the legislature, prior to the effective date of this amendment, for the use or benefit of the Alabama Housing Finance Authority and which, as of the effective date of this amendment, is required by any then applicable law to be held apart from the trust fund and not included with the moneys to be transferred into such fund as part of the initial trust capital;

(4) Any amount of such proceeds, income or profit not exceeding $6,000,000 which has been appropriated by the legislature, prior to the effective date of this amendment, for the reimbursement of the counties of the state for expenses incurred by such counties in the incarceration or confinement of convicts or other prisoners who are the responsibility of the state; and

(5) Any amount of such proceeds, income or profit not exceeding $10,000,000 which has been appropriated by the legislature, prior to the effective date of this amendment, for the support and encouragement of educational, agricultural and industrial activities involving basic and applied scientific research and development.

Promptly following the effective date of this amendment, the state treasurer shall take all actions necessary to transfer to the board the possession, control and management of the initial trust capital. If at the time of such transfer into the trust fund all or part of the initial trust capital is invested in certificates of deposit or other investments which cannot be converted into cash prior to the maturity thereof without loss of interest or other penalty, the state treasurer shall directly transfer such certificates of deposit or other investments to the board as part of the initial trust capital without first converting the same into cash. In the event that any certificates of deposit or other investments shall be transferred into the trust fund, the initial trust capital shall include only the income or profit from such certificates of deposit or other investments that has been received by the state on or before such transfer or that constitutes accrued interest, amortized discount or other amounts which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, should be considered as having been earned by the state as of the date of such transfer. To the extent that any income or profit derived from such certificates of deposit or other investments is referable to any period after the transfer thereof into the trust fund, such income or profit shall constitute trust income and shall not constitute part of the trust capital (except to the extent otherwise provided by Section 5(a) of this amendment). Any provision of this amendment to the contrary notwithstanding, no oil and gas capital payment received by the state after November 1, 1981, or any income from the investment thereof, shall, unless subsequently authorized by law, be transferred into the trust fund.

(b) The trust capital shall be augmented by any trust income which, as provided in Section 5(a) of this amendment, shall have remained in the trust fund beyond the end of the fiscal year next succeeding the fiscal year during which it was received without having been appropriated for any purpose by act of the legislature. The trust capital shall also consist of (i) such other moneys or assets as the legislature may by law appropriate and transfer to the trust fund as a permanent part thereof and (ii) such other moneys or assets as may be contributed to the trust fund from any source.

Section 5. Investment of Moneys in Trust Fund; Appropriation of Trust Income. (a) Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 6 of this amendment, the trust capital shall be held in perpetual trust and shall not be appropriated by the legislature or expended or disbursed for any purpose other than to acquire eligible investments in accordance with the provisions of this amendment. All eligible investments acquired, in whole or in part, with moneys constituting part of the trust capital shall to the extent of such moneys constitute part of the trust capital, but any trust income derived therefrom shall be subject to appropriation and withdrawal by the legislature to the extent provided in this amendment. Until and including the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding the fiscal year during which any trust income shall be received into the trust fund, the legislature may at any time and from time to time, whether before or after the actual receipt of such trust income, enact laws appropriating all or any part of such trust income for any lawful purpose, and any trust income so appropriated may be withdrawn from the trust fund at any time after the receipt thereof; provided, however, that the right of the legislature to appropriate any trust income prior to the actual receipt thereof shall not be construed to authorize the recognition and withdrawal of any moneys equivalent to such trust income prior to the actual receipt thereof into the trust fund. If any trust income shall not be appropriated by a law which becomes effective on or before the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding that during which it was received, such trust income shall thereafter cease to be subject to appropriation and shall become part of the trust capital to be held in the trust fund on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to all other assets constituting the trust capital. Any trust income appropriated by a law becoming effective on or before the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding that during which it was received shall remain trust income even though it is permitted to remain in the trust fund after the end of such fiscal year, and any such trust income shall be subject to withdrawal from the trust fund at any time thereafter in the manner provided by law for the purposes for which it shall theretofore have been appropriated.

(b) To the extent practicable, the board shall keep all moneys at any time held in the trust fund (including both trust capital and trust income) invested in such eligible investments as shall, in its sole and uncontrolled judgment, produce the greatest trust income over the term of such investments while preserving the trust capital. In making any investment of moneys held in the trust fund, the board shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such investment, which an institutional investor of the highest standard of prudence, intelligence and financial expertise would exercise in the management and investment of large assets entrusted to it not for the purpose of speculative profit but for the permanent generation and disposition of funds, considering the probable safety of capital as well as the expected amount and frequency of income. The board shall have full power and authority to select the eligible investments in which moneys held in the trust fund shall at any time be invested, and, to the extent not inconsistent with any express provision of this amendment, the eligible investments so selected shall be acquired from such issuers, underwriters, brokers or other sellers on such terms and conditions, shall be acquired for purchase prices reflecting such discount below or premium above the par or face amount thereof, shall bear such dates and be in such form, denominations and series, shall mature or be subject to mandatory redemption on such dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such intervals or, alternatively, shall provide income to the holder thereof in such other manner (including, without limitation thereto, the purchase of such investments at a discount which represents all or part of the income or profit to be derived therefrom), shall be unsecured or secured in such manner, shall contain such provisions for prepayment or redemption at the option of the issuer or obligor, and shall contain or be subject to such other provisions as shall, in all of the foregoing respects, be determined by the board in the exercise of its sole and uncontrolled judgment. The board shall have full power and authority to invest the trust capital in long-term investments producing trust income in accordance with such schedule as the board shall, in the exercise of its sole and uncontrolled judgment, determine to be in the best interests of the state, and in determining such schedule the board may emphasize future benefits in preference to near-term needs. The board shall have complete and uncontrolled discretion in making decisions as to when moneys in the trust fund shall be invested, as to the purchase price or other acquisition cost to be paid or incurred in acquiring investments for the trust fund, as to when investments constituting part of the trust fund shall be sold, liquidated or otherwise disposed of, and, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 100 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as to the amount and nature of the price or other consideration to be received by the trust fund upon the sale, liquidation or other disposition of investments constituting part of the trust fund; provided, however, that to the extent the provisions of this amendment authorize the withdrawal of moneys from the trust fund (including both trust capital and trust income) pursuant to appropriation by the legislature, the board shall invest the moneys so subject to withdrawal in investments which shall mature or otherwise be subject to liquidation on such terms as will provide cash when required for withdrawal from the trust fund. No law shall be enacted nor any action taken by the executive department of the state which impairs or interferes with the power, authority and discretion conferred upon the board by this amendment with respect to the acquisition, management, control and disposition of investments at any time constituting part of the trust fund.

(c) The trust income for any period shall be the net income (determined as hereinafter provided) actually received in cash or cash equivalents during such period from the investment and reinvestment of all moneys held in the trust fund (including both moneys representing trust capital and moneys representing previously received trust income that has not become part of the trust capital). No accrual or other accounting calculation or classification shall constitute the basis for recognizing trust income unless the moneys in question shall have been actually received and paid into the trust fund. The trust income for any period shall consist of the aggregate interest received from investments during such period plus any profit realized during such period from any payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition of investments resulting in the receipt of an amount greater than the purchase price thereof, less (i) any negative audit adjustments to income and any losses with respect to investments which are required to be charged against the income of the trust fund for such period pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, (ii) any accrued interest paid as part of the purchase price of investments acquired during such period, and (iii) all expenses of selling and disposing of investments during such period such as brokerage commissions, legal expenses referable to a particular transaction, transfer taxes and other customary transactional expenses. For purposes of determining the amount of the trust capital at any time held in the trust fund, any investment acquired for a purchase price reflecting a discount below its face or par amount shall, at all times prior to its payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition, be valued at its original purchase price. If any investment is acquired for a purchase price reflecting a premium above its face or par amount, then, for purposes of calculating trust income, the cumulative interest or other income theretofore received from such investment as of any time shall be reduced by the then applicable amortized premium of such investment. For purposes of determining the amount of trust capital at any time held in the trust fund, any investment acquired for a purchase price reflecting a premium above its face or par amount shall, at all times prior to its payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition, be valued at its original purchase price less its then applicable amortized premium.

(d) The trust income shall be adjusted in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this subsection if the application of generally accepted accounting principles in connection with the annual audit of the trust fund requires any negative adjustment of income, including the recognition of any reduction in value or write off of investments for reasons relating to the probability of their payment or collectibility, or if any loss is realized upon any payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition of any investment resulting in the receipt of any amount less than the value thereof determined in accordance with the provisions of this amendment; provided, however, that no reduction in value of any investment shall be made because the rate of interest or other yield thereon has fallen below the market rates then applicable to comparable investments. Any audit adjustment resulting in a charge against income or any loss realized from the payment, sale, liquidation or other disposition of investments, as the case may be, shall be charged first against any trust income which, as of the time such adjustment is made or such loss is realized, has accumulated in the trust fund and is then available for withdrawal, whether or not theretofore appropriated, and if the amount to be so charged is greater than the amount of accumulated trust income subject to withdrawal, such amount shall be charged against trust income thereafter received in the current and succeeding fiscal years until the full amount of such audit adjustment or loss, as the case may be, has been recovered or made good out of the investment income of the trust fund, and from and after the time that such audit adjustment is made or such loss is realized, as the case may be, no income of the trust fund shall be considered trust income for purposes of this amendment until the full amount of such adjustment or loss shall have been so recovered or made good. In the event that, as a result of any audit adjustment or any realized loss, the aggregate amount of income appropriated and withdrawn from the trust fund as of any time during or at the end of any fiscal year exceeds the aggregate trust income which, taking into account such adjustment or loss, should have been available for withdrawal at or before such time, then, and in such event, the excess amount so withdrawn need not be returned to the trust fund from the general fund of the state or from any other source of funds available to the state, but the amount of such excess withdrawal shall be recovered through charges against future income of the trust fund as above provided.

(e) To the extent appropriate and not at the time prohibited by law, the board shall use the facilities of the state treasurer in the administration of the trust fund, including, but without limitation thereto, the keeping of records, the management of bank accounts, the transfer of funds and the safekeeping of securities evidencing investments.

(f) The board shall cause an annual audit of the trust fund to be performed for each fiscal year by the state auditor or, in the discretion of the board, by an independent accounting firm and shall cause a report of such audit to be prepared in accordance with applicable accounting principles and made public within ninety (90) days following the end of the fiscal year covered thereby. The board shall cause to be prepared and publicized such financial and other information concerning the trust fund as may from time to time be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature, but in the absence of any law directing the preparation and publication of different reports, the board shall cause to be prepared and made public, within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarterly period in each fiscal year, a report containing (i) a statement of the trust capital then held in the trust fund showing any changes thereto since the last quarterly report, (ii) a statement of the trust income then held in the trust fund showing receipts and withdrawals therefrom during the quarterly period in question and further showing the portion thereof previously appropriated and the portion thereof subject to appropriation but not then appropriated, (iii) a statement of the investments then held in the trust fund including descriptions thereof and the respective values thereof, (iv) a statement of the trust income received to date during the current fiscal year, (v) if such report covers the first, second or third quarterly period, an estimate of the trust income anticipated for the entire current fiscal year and for each of the remaining quarterly periods thereof, and (vi) an estimate of the trust income anticipated for the next succeeding fiscal year and in each of the quarterly periods thereof.

Section 6. Alternative Disposition of Certain Trust Fund Moneys. (a) By any duly enacted law or laws, whether becoming effective before or after the effective date of this amendment, the legislature may appropriate moneys constituting trust capital or trust income or a combination of both for the use or benefit of the Alabama Housing Finance Authority in such aggregate amount as, when added to any amount excluded from the initial trust capital pursuant to clause (3) of the first sentence of Section 4 of this amendment, shall not exceed the sum of $19,500,000. All or any part of the moneys so appropriated may be held in the trust fund until disbursed for the purpose for which appropriated, or all or any part of such moneys may be immediately withdrawn from the trust fund and transferred to the Alabama Housing Finance Authority for the use thereof or, alternatively, transferred to the state and held by it until used to pay expenses for and on behalf of such authority, all in accordance with such law or laws as may from time to time be enacted by the legislature.

(b) In order to provide an alternative source for the moneys appropriated for the use of the board of corrections pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 81-764 enacted at the 1981 Regular Session of the legislature, the legislature may, by any duly enacted law or laws, whether becoming effective before or after the effective date of this amendment, appropriate moneys constituting trust capital or trust income or a combination of both for the use of the board of corrections in making capital expenditures; provided, however, that the aggregate amount so appropriated for the use of the board of corrections and withdrawn from the trust fund shall not exceed an amount computed as the difference between $45,000,000 and the sum of (i) the amount excluded from the initial trust capital pursuant to clause (1) of the first sentence of Section 4 of this amendment and (ii) all other amounts at any time appropriated by the legislature from the proceeds of bonds of the state or other sources for the use of the board of corrections in substitution for or replacement of all or any part of the moneys appropriated pursuant to said Act No. 81-764.

(c) In order to provide an alternative source for the moneys appropriated for the use of the department of mental health pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 81-770 enacted at the 1981 Regular Session of the legislature, the legislature may, by any duly enacted law or laws, whether or not becoming effective before or after the effective date of this amendment, appropriate moneys constituting trust capital or trust income or a combination of both for the use of the department of mental health in making capital expenditures; provided, however, that the aggregate amount so appropriated for the use of the department of mental health and withdrawn from the trust fund shall not exceed an amount computed as the difference between $65,000,000 and the sum of (i) the amount excluded from the initial trust capital pursuant to clause (2) of the first sentence of Section 4 of this amendment and (ii) all other amounts at any time appropriated by the legislature from the proceeds of bonds of the state or other sources for the use of the department of mental health in substitution for or replacement of all or any part of the moneys appropriated pursuant to said Act No. 81-770.

Section 7. Limitation of Personal Liability of Trustees. An individual trustee shall not in any way be personally liable for any liability, loss or expense suffered by the trust fund unless such liability, loss or expense arises out of or results from the willful misconduct or wrongdoing of such trustee.

Section 8. Legislative Oversight Commission. (a) There is hereby created the Alabama Heritage Trust Fund Legislative Oversight Commission to consist of the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house, and five members each from the house of representatives and the senate to be appointed by the speaker of the house and the lieutenant governor, respectively. If the legislature is in regular session at the time this amendment shall become effective, the original members of the commission shall be appointed at such regular session, and if the legislature is not in regular session at the time this amendment shall become effective, the members of the commission shall be appointed at the next regular session of the legislature. The original members of the commission shall serve for the remainder of their elected terms of office as members of the legislature, and the terms of office of members of the commission shall thereafter correspond to the full four-year terms for which members of the legislature are elected. If at any time there shall be a vacancy among the appointed members of the commission, a successor shall be appointed from the same body of the legislature as that to which the previous incumbent belonged, and such successor shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term of such previous incumbent.

(b) The commission shall hold an organizational meeting at the state capitol within ten (10) days after the appointment of the original members thereof, and shall elect a chairman and vice chairman from among its members. Thereafter, the commission shall meet, from time to time, at the call of the chairman or vice chairman or upon the request of seven or more members, with such notice and in accordance with such procedure as shall be prescribed by the rules of the commission.

**Issuance of Interest Bearing Bonds for Specified Purposes.**

The state of Alabama is authorized to become indebted and to sell and issue its interest bearing bonds, in addition to all other bonds of the state, in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $520,000,000. The expenses incurred in the sale and issuance of said bonds shall be paid out of the proceeds derived from the sale thereof. The proceeds of said bonds shall be paid into the state treasury, shall be kept continually invested pending the expenditure thereof, and shall, together with the income derived from the investment and reinvestment thereof (including income derived from the investment and reinvestment of previously derived income), be retained in one or more separate accounts of the state treasury until expended for the purposes authorized in this amendment and in the manner provided by law. The proceeds of said bonds remaining after payment of the expenses of selling and issuing the same, together with the investment income derived from said proceeds, shall be used solely for the purpose of paying the capital costs of public facilities and works of internal improvement consisting of (i) public roads, streets, highways and bridges, (ii) buildings, equipment and other facilities for public schools, public technical and vocational schools and public institutions of higher education, (iii) state prisons, facilities for the housing, training, education or rehabilitation of prisoners, and other facilities necessary or useful in connection with prisons and other penal or correctional facilities, (iv) mental hospitals and other mental health facilities, (v) the improvement of navigation in Mobile Harbor by the deepening and widening of channels therein and the construction and installation of dock and wharf facilities in Mobile Harbor and on navigable inland waterways, (vi) the renovation and restoration of buildings in the main governmental complex of the state, including the State Capitol Building and the present headquarters office building of the state highway department, (vii) the construction and equipment of a new headquarters office building for the state highway department, (viii) facilities for the Alabama department of youth services, (ix) the renovation and restoration of the State Coliseum in Montgomery county, (x) public parks and park facilities, the acquisition of land for conservation and preservation by the Alabama department of conservation and natural resources, the planting of shells to be used as mulch for the improvement of oyster cultivation and other maricultural activities in Alabama coastal waters, bays and sounds, and (xi) equipment for the Alabama Educational Television Commission.

The legislature shall enact appropriate implementing laws to provide for the sale and issuance of the bonds authorized by this amendment, to appropriate and allocate the proceeds thereof, together with the investment income derived from said proceeds, among the hereinbefore described purposes, and otherwise to carry out the intent and purpose of this amendment.

The state of Alabama is also authorized to become indebted and to sell and issue one or more series of bonds to refund all or any of the bonds authorized by this amendment in such principal amount or amounts (which may exceed the principal amount of the bonds being refunded) and in such manner as may be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature.

All bonds issued pursuant to this amendment (including refunding bonds) may be sold at public or private sale, with or without competitive bidding, to such person or persons, at such price or prices and upon such terms as the governor, the director of finance and the state treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state.

## Amendment 396
**Payment by State of Expenses Incurred by Alabama Housing Finance Authority.**

Any provision of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 or amendments thereto to the contrary notwithstanding, the legislature may from time to time by law provide for the payment by the state of Alabama of expenses incurred by the Alabama Housing Finance Authority (organized pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 80-585 enacted at the 1980 Regular Session of the legislature) in the exercise of the powers granted to it by law, including, but without limitation, expenses incurred by the Alabama Housing Finance Authority in the issuance of its bonds and the utilization of the proceeds therefrom to make or acquire mortgage loans to private persons, firms or corporations that are secured by mortgages on single or multi-family residential property located in the state. The legislature may appropriate moneys from any available source for the direct payment of such expenses or it may authorize the transfer of moneys to the Alabama Housing Finance Authority to be used for that purpose. Notwithstanding the payment by the state, either directly or indirectly, in any manner authorized herein, of the expenses incurred by the Alabama Housing Finance Authority, no bonds or others evidences of indebtedness issued by the Alabama Housing Finance Authority shall be deemed to constitute an indebtedness of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision whatsoever, nor shall any action taken by the Alabama Housing Finance Authority be deemed to constitute a lending of money or credit by the state to any individual, association, or corporation, or a participation by the state in works of internal improvement, within the meaning of Section 93 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as amended.

This amendment shall have no force and effect after December 31, 1983, and shall not constitute a part of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 after such date, but the expiration thereof on such date shall not be considered by any court as a reason for holding unconstitutional any law which would have been constitutional without the adoption of this amendment.

## Amendment 397
**Amendment of Section 110.**

**"General law," "local law" and "special law" defined.**

A general law is a law which in its terms and effect applies either to the whole state, or to one or more municipalities of the state less than the whole in a class. A general law applicable to such a class of municipalities shall define the class on the basis of criteria reasonably related to the purpose of the law, provided that the legislature may also enact and change from time to time a general schedule of not more than eight classes of municipalities based on population according to any designated federal decennial census, and general laws for any purpose may thereafter be enacted for any such class. Any law heretofore enacted which complies with the provisions of this section shall be considered a general law.

No general law which at the time of its enactment applies to only one municipality of the state shall be enacted, unless notice of the intention to apply therefor shall have been given and shown as provided in Section 106 of this Constitution for special, private or local laws; provided, that such notice shall not be deemed to constitute such law a local law.

A special or private law is one which applies to an individual, association or corporation. A local law is a law which is not a general law or a special or private law.

Act No. 79-263 (House Bill No. 68) entitled "An Act to establish eight classes of municipalities, by population, based on the 1970 Federal decennial census" approved June 28, 1979, and each and every Act of the legislature thereafter enacted referred or relating to a class of municipalities as established in said Act No. 79-263 are hereby in all things ratified, approved, validated and confirmed as of the date of their enactment, any provision or provisions of the Constitution of Alabama, as amended, to the contrary notwithstanding.

## Amendment 398
**Certain County Revenue Securities not to Constitute Bonds or Indebtedness.**

Revenue bonds or other revenue securities at any time issued by a county for the purpose of extending, enlarging or improving any water, sewer, gas or electric system then owned by such county shall not be deemed to constitute bonds or indebtedness of such county within the meaning of Sections 222, 224 or Amendment No. 342 of this Constitution, if by their terms such bonds or other securities are not made a charge on the general credit or tax revenues of the issuing county and are made payable solely out of revenues derived from the operation of any one or more of such systems.

## Amendment 399
**Amendment of Section 264.**

**Board of trustees of state university.**

The state university shall be under the management and control of a board of trustees, which shall consist of two members from each congressional district in the state, an additional member from the congressional district which includes the site of the first campus of the university, the superintendent of education, and the governor, who shall be ex officio president of the board. The members of the board of trustees as now constituted shall hold office until their respective terms expire under existing law, and until their successors shall be elected and confirmed as hereinafter required. The additional trustees provided for by this amendment shall be elected by the existing members of the board, and confirmed by the senate in the manner provided below, for initial terms of not more than six years established by the board so that one term shall expire each three years in each congressional district. Successors to the terms of the existing and additional trustees shall hold office for a term of six years, and shall not serve more than three consecutive full six-year terms on the board; provided however that a trustee shall retire from the board and vacate office at the annual meeting of the board following that trustee's seventieth birthday. Election of additional and successor trustees or of trustees to fill any vacancy created by the expiration of a term or by the death or resignation of any member or from any other cause shall be by the remaining members of the board by secret ballot; provided, that any trustee so elected shall hold office from the date of election until confirmation or rejection by the senate, and, if confirmed, until the expiration of the term for which elected, and until a successor is elected. At every meeting of the legislature the superintendent of education shall certify to the senate the names of all who shall have been so elected since the last session of the legislature, and the senate shall confirm or reject them, as it shall determine is for the best interest of the university. If it rejects the names of any members, it shall thereupon elect trustees in the stead of those rejected. No trustee shall receive any pay or emolument other than his actual expenses incurred in the discharge of his duties as such. Upon the vacation of office by a trustee, the board, if it desires, may bestow upon a trustee the honorary title of trustee emeritus, but such status shall confer no responsibilities, duties, rights, or privileges as such.

Assessments, fees or other charges collected as authorized by any legislative act adopted in pursuance hereof shall not be considered as a tax within the meaning of this Constitution or any provision thereof. Any uniformity requirements of this Constitution shall be satisfied by the application of the program upon swine and swine products.

The county commission is further authorized to enter into agreements with volunteer fire departments within such county for fire protection and services.

There is hereby levied, in addition to any taxes now authorized or that may be hereafter authorized by the Constitution and laws of Alabama, a fire protection tax of three mills. The fire protection tax levied herein shall be based upon the value of real and personal property assessed by affected property owners, as shown on the records of the tax assessor of Etowah county, Alabama, and shall be assessed and collected as are all ad valorem taxes in the county. The amount collected each year from assessment of this fire protection tax shall be paid into the county general fund and used in furtherance of fire protection within the affected area. Prior to the levy of the fire protection tax in a fire district, there shall be submitted to the electors of the district, at a special election called for that purpose in the district, the question of whether the said tax shall be levied, and the said tax shall be authorized at such election by a majority of the qualified electors within any particular fire district of the county or corporate municipality therein who vote at such election; provided further, that if a majority of the qualified electors of any of the fire districts participating in the election on the ratification of this amendment shall vote for the ratification of this amendment, then the approval of this amendment as expressed by the vote in said district in favor of its ratification shall, of itself, authorize the levy and collection of the tax for fire protection purposes in that fire district, commencing with the levy for the tax year for which taxes will become due and payable on October 1, 1985.

Elections on the question of the levy of a district fire protection tax may be held at any time and from time to time, provided, that if any such election held after the ratification of this amendment the proposal to levy the tax so submitted should be defeated then the proposal may not be submitted at another election held in the same district within two years from the last election held under this amendment.

Any act heretofore enacted regarding said Etowah county fire fighting districts is hereby ratified and confirmed insofar as it is consistent with this amendment.

## Amendment 446
**Bonds of Alabama State Docks Department not Debt of State.**

Bonds or other securities issued by or on behalf of the Alabama state docks department shall not constitute a debt of the state within the meaning of Section 213 of this Constitution, as heretofore or hereafter amended, or any similar provision of this Constitution supplemental to, or superseding, said Section 213, as so amended, if by their terms such bonds or securities do not constitute a charge on the general credit or tax revenues of the state, but are payable solely from any or all of the revenues from any or all of the state docks facilities wherever situated (whether of [or] not such facilities were in existence or owned by or on behalf of the state at the time such bonds or securities were issued) or from sources other than state taxes, licenses or appropriations; provided, however, that the proceeds of any fee, tariff or charge (regardless of how denominated or calculated) collected by the Alabama state docks department in connection with the operation of the state docks facilities wherever situated shall be considered revenues from such facilities within the meaning of this amendment.

"OUTSTANDING SECURITIES" means any bonds, warrants, notes or other securities issued by the county subsequent to September 30, 1979, and prior to February 1, 1984, that are payable in whole or in part out of proceeds received by the county from the ad valorem tax authorized by Section 215 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as amended.

"OUTSTANDING SPECIAL TAX SECURITIES" means any securities at the time outstanding that are payable in whole or in part out of proceeds of the special tax.

Section B. Mobile county is hereby authorized to apply proceeds of the special tax to the payment of the principal of and interest on and premium, if any) that will hereafter mature or otherwise become payable on the outstanding securities. The right of the county to apply the proceeds of the special tax for payment of the outstanding securities shall be subject to the provisions of this Constitution respecting the special tax and the pledge thereof for the benefit of the outstanding special tax securities. The proceeds of the special tax may be used for payment of the principal and interest on (and premium, if any) the outstanding securities, whether or not any bonds are issued hereunder.

Section C. Mobile county is hereby authorized to issue from time to time its bonds for the purpose of refunding all or any one or more of the issues of outstanding securities. The aggregate principal amount of all bonds at any time issued under this amendment, when added to the aggregate principal amount of all then outstanding bonds theretofore issued by the county under any other amendment to the Constitution of Alabama that are payable from or secured by the special tax shall not exceed 6 1/2 per centum of the assessed valuation of taxable property situated in the county as assessed for county taxation for the fiscal year of the county next preceding that during which any bonds herein authorized shall be issued.

No bonds may be issued under the authority of this amendment until after the question of the issuance of such bonds shall have been submitted to the qualified electors of the county at an election called for that purpose by the governing body of the county and a majority of the said qualified electors voting at the said election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds; provided, that if a majority of the qualified electors of the county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment shall vote for the adoption thereof, then the approval of this amendment expressed by the said vote in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the issuance of the bonds provided for in the first sentence of this amendment and no additional election by the electors of the county shall be required to authorize the issuance of those bonds. If the majority of the qualified electors of the county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment should not vote in favor of the adoption of this amendment, or if the majority of the qualified electors of the county voting at any election called by the governing body of the county under the provisions of this amendment should not vote in favor of the issuance of the bonds proposed at an election so called, the governing body of the county may from time to time call other elections hereunder on the issuance of such bonds, but not more than one such election shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months. Any such election called by the governing body of the county shall be called, held, conducted and canvassed, and may be contested, in the manner and within the time provided by the then existing general laws of Alabama pertaining to elections on the issuance of bonds by counties.

The bonds issued hereunder shall be general obligations of the county for the payment of the principal of and interest on which the full faith and credit of the county shall be irrevocably pledged, and in addition thereto there shall be irrevocably pledged for payment of the said principal and interest so much of the special tax as may be necessary to pay the said principal and interest at their respective maturities, each such pledge to be on a parity with all valid pledges of the special tax at any time heretofore or hereafter made, to such extent as shall not impair the obligations of any then existing valid prior pledges.

All bonds issued under this amendment may be in such aggregate principal amounts, may be in such form and denominations and of such tenor and maturities, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times, not exceeding in the case of each such bond 30 years from its date, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent with this amendment as shall be provided in the proceedings of the governing body of the county whereunder such bonds shall be authorized to be issued. Except as herein otherwise provided, all bonds issued under this amendment shall be issued in accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of the general laws of Alabama existing at the time of the issuance of such bonds respecting the sale, execution, issuance and redemption of bonds by counties. The indebtedness evidenced by the bonds issued under this amendment or under any other amendment to the Constitution which are payable out of or are secured by a pledge of the special tax shall be in addition to and shall not be charged against the limitation on the indebtedness of the county provided for in Section 224 of the Constitution.

So long as the principal of or interest on any of the bonds issued under this amendment remains unpaid, the governing body of Mobile county shall continue the levy of the special tax at such rate as may be sufficient to pay the said principal and interest at their respective maturities. The rate at which the county may levy the special tax is hereby fixed at 6 1/2 mills on each dollar of the assessed valuation of properties subject to taxation by the county as assessed for county taxation, which rate shall be the maximum rate at which the county may levy the special tax except to the extent that the said rate may be increased pursuant to provisions of this constitution hereafter adopted. Such rate shall not be subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of amendment 195 to the constitution.

Section D. The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing, and authorization from or other action by the legislature shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of bonds hereunder, the levy of the special tax for payment thereof, or the use of the proceeds of the special tax for the purpose of paying the principal of or interest on the outstanding securities.

(D) Upon the signing and presentation to the governor in accordance with the said Sections 66 and 125 of bills making the basic appropriations, the provisions of the foregoing paragraph (C) prohibiting the final passage of bills in the house and senate (other than bills making any part of the basic appropriations) shall cease to be effective and shall not be revived or become again effective as a result of (i) the subsequent legislative history of any bill so signed and presented, including any veto, return with executive amendment, or any other action, or failure to act, by either the governor or the legislature under the provisions of the said Section 125; or (ii) a determination, by either judicial decree or opinion of the justices of the Alabama Supreme Court, that any bill so signed and presented is wholly or in part invalid.

(E) The legislature may, by statute or rule, make such further provisions for the timely passage of bills making the basic appropriations as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution.

Section 3. (a) The trust fund shall be under the management and control of the board, and all powers necessary or appropriate for the management and control of the trust fund shall be vested solely in the board. The board shall have a membership of nine trustees consisting of the governor, the state treasurer, the director of finance (or such other official as may by law succeed to the responsibilities of the director of finance), three trustees appointed by the governor, two trustees appointed by the lieutenant governor, and one trustee appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives. The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance shall each serve as a trustee ex officio, and the service of each such official as a trustee shall begin and end concurrently with the beginning and end of his or her tenure in such office. As promptly as practicable after the effective date of this amendment, the other trustees shall be appointed for the following initial terms: The trustees to be appointed by the governor shall be appointed for terms beginning immediately upon their respective appointments and ending at noon on October 1, in the first, second and third calendar years, respectively, next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective; the trustees to be appointed by the lieutenant governor shall be appointed for terms beginning immediately upon their respective appointments and ending at noon on October 1, in the fourth and fifth calendar years, respectively, next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective; and the trustee to be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives shall be appointed for a term beginning immediately upon his or her appointment and ending at noon on October 1, in the sixth calendar year next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective. Thereafter, the term of office of each appointed trustee shall be six years, commencing at noon on October 1 on which the term of the immediate predecessor trustee shall end.

(b) If at any time there shall be a vacancy among the appointed trustees, a successor trustee shall be appointed to serve for the unexpired term applicable to such vacancy. The appointment of each appointed trustee (other than those initially appointed), whether for a full six-year term or to complete an unexpired term, shall be made by the same officer of the state who appointed the trustee whose term shall have expired or is to expire or in whose position on the board a vacancy otherwise exists and shall be made not earlier than 30 days prior to the date on which such trustee is to take office as such. Each appointed trustee shall hold office from the effective date of his or her appointment by and with the consent of the senate and shall hold office until his or her successor is appointed as provided for herein. Trustees shall be eligible for reappointment without limit as to the number of terms previously served.

(d) Each appointed trustee shall, at the time of his or her appointment and at all times during his or her term of office, be a qualified elector of the state, and a failure by any trustee to remain so qualified during such term shall cause a vacancy of the office of such trustee. Each appointed trustee shall have recognized competence and experience in the evaluation and management of investments. Any appointed trustee may be impeached and removed from office as a trustee in the same manner and on the same grounds provided in section 174 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or successor provision thereof, and the general laws of the state for impeachment and removal of the officers of the state subject to said section 174 or successor provision thereof. The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance may not be impeached and removed from office as trustees apart from their impeachment and removal from the respective offices by virtue of which, ex officio, they serve as trustees.

(e) The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance shall be entitled to vote, and shall perform the duties of trustees, ex officio, without any compensation other than that to which they are respectively entitled as governor, state treasurer and director of finance. Appointed trustees shall be entitled to such compensation for their services as may from time to time be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature, but the power to provide compensation of appointed trustees shall be discretionary with the legislature and nothing in this amendment shall be construed to confer upon such trustees an absolute right to any compensation for their services. Each trustee shall be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred in the performance of his or her duties as a trustee.

(f) A majority of the trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the board, and decisions shall be made on the basis of a majority of the quorum then present and voting, with each trustee to have a single vote. No vacancy in the membership of the board or the voluntary disqualification or abstention of any trustee shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all of the powers and duties of the board. The governor shall be the chairman and presiding officer of the board. The director of finance shall be vice chairman, and the state treasurer shall serve as secretary. The board may appoint such other officers to perform such duties, not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment or applicable law, as the board shall deem necessary or appropriate. In addition to such regular meetings of the board as may be provided by law or by bylaws or rules duly adopted by the board, special meetings of the board may be called by the governor acting alone or by any three other trustees acting in concert, in each case upon two days' notice to each trustee given in person or by registered letter or telegram; provided, however, that such notice to each trustee may be waived by such trustee, either before or after the meeting with respect to which such notice would otherwise be required. Any meeting held by the board for any purpose shall be open to the public, except that executive sessions may be held by the board when the character or good name of a person is involved. All proceedings of the board, except executive sessions, shall be reduced to writing on behalf of the board and maintained in the permanent records of the board, a copy of which shall be filed in the principal office of the board and shall be open for public inspection there during regular business hours. The principal office of the board shall be the principal office of the director of finance.

(g) No trustee shall vote on or participate in the discussion or consideration of any matter coming before the board in which such trustee, personally or through family connections or business associations, has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including, but without limitation thereto, decisions of the board concerning the investment of moneys constituting part of the trust fund in any deposit or obligation of any bank or corporation in which such trustee may have such an interest. If there shall be brought before the board any matter in which a trustee shall have any interest which may conflict with his or her duties as a trustee, he or she shall immediately make a complete disclosure to the board of such interest and shall thereafter withdraw from participation in any deliberation and decision of the board with respect to such matter.

(h) The board shall have all of the powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this amendment, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following powers:

(1) To adopt, alter and repeal bylaws, regulations and rules for the regulation and conduct of its affairs and business;

(2) To make, enter into and execute contracts, agreements and other instruments and to take such other actions as may be necessary or convenient to accomplish any purpose for which the trust fund was created or to exercise any power expressly, or by reasonable implication, granted by this amendment;

(3) To enter into contracts with, to accept aid and grants from, to cooperate with and to do any and all things that may be necessary in order to avail itself of the aid and cooperation of the United States of America, the state or any agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of either thereof in furtherance of the purposes of this amendment; and

(4) To appoint, employ and contract with such employees, agents, advisors and consultants, including, but not limited to, attorneys, accountants, financial experts and such other advisors, consultants and agents as may in its judgment be necessary or desirable, and to fix their compensation; provided, however, that any obligation created or assumed by the board shall not create any pecuniary obligation or liability of the state or the trust fund other than such as shall be payable out of moneys appropriated by the legislature to defray the expenses of the board in carrying out the purposes of this amendment. No lien or charge against any assets of the trust fund for any purpose whatsoever shall be created by or result from any law enacted by the legislature or any action taken by the board or any other department, agency or instrumentality of the state.

(i) The expenses of making and disposing of investments, such as brokerage commissions, legal expenses referable to a particular transaction, transfer taxes and other customary transactional expenses shall be payable out of any trust income of the trust fund. The legislature shall provide for the administrative and other necessary expenses of the board in the same manner as it provides for the expenses of operating other departments and agencies of the state.

Section 4. (a) There shall be transferred from the general fund of the state into the trust fund, as the initial trust capital, moneys in an amount equal to the sum of all proceeds of any oil and gas capital payments received by the state pursuant to the sealed bids awarded on August 14, 1984, including any revenues and earnings deposited in any fund pursuant to section 9-17-68, Code of Alabama 1975; provided, however, that the division of lands of the department of conservation and natural resources shall be entitled to four percent of the $347,483,000 which has been received by the state pursuant to the sealed bids awarded on August 14, 1984, which sum shall be carried in the state treasury to the credit of the state lands fund.

Promptly following the effective date of this amendment, the state treasurer shall take all actions necessary to transfer to the board the possession, control and management of the initial trust capital. If at the time of such transfer into the trust fund all or part of the initial trust capital is invested in certificates of deposit or other investments which cannot be converted into cash prior to the maturity thereof without loss of interest or other penalty, the state treasurer shall directly transfer such certificates of deposit or other investments to the board as part of the initial trust capital without first converting the same into cash. In the event that any certificates of deposit or other investments shall be transferred into the trust fund, the initial trust capital shall not include the income or profit from such certificates of deposit or other investments that has been received by the state on or before such transfer or that constitutes accrued interest, amortized discount or other amounts which in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, should be considered as having been earned by the state as of the date of such transfer. Any such income or profits from such certificates of deposit or other investments that has been received by the state on or before such transfer shall remain in the general fund subject to appropriation by the legislature. To the extent that any income or profit derived from such certificates of deposits or other investments is referable to any period after the transfer thereof into the trust fund, such income or profit shall not constitute trust capital nor trust income but shall remain in the general fund subject to appropriation by the legislature.

(b) The trust capital shall be augmented by (i) such other moneys or assets as the legislature may by law appropriate and transfer to the trust fund as a permanent part thereof; (ii) such other moneys or assets as may be contributed to the trust fund from any source; and (iii) all proceeds of any oil and gas capital payments as defined in this amendment subsequent to August 14, 1984; provided, however, that the division of lands of the department of conservation and natural resources shall be entitled to one percent of all proceeds of any oil and gas capital payments as defined in this amendment subsequent to August 14, 1984, which sum shall be carried in the state treasury to the credit of the state lands fund. In addition, within 90 days after September 1, 2001, the board of trustees of the Alabama heritage trust fund shall transfer the trust capital of the Alabama heritage trust fund to the Alabama trust fund and shall transfer the trust income of the Alabama heritage trust fund to the state general fund. The trust capital received by the Alabama trust fund from the Alabama heritage trust fund shall thereafter be trust capital of the Alabama trust fund. The Alabama heritage trust fund, the board of trustees of the Alabama heritage trust fund, and all other aspects of the Alabama heritage trust fund shall terminate and dissolve 90 days after September 1, 2001.

(c) Provided, however, beginning with state fiscal year 1989-90, one percent of the income from the Alabama trust fund shall be reinvested in the Alabama trust fund; two percent of such income shall be reinvested in the following year; and one additional percent of such income each subsequent year shall be reinvested until a total of 10 percent of such income from the Alabama trust fund each year shall be reinvested in the Alabama trust fund.

Section 5. (a) The trust capital shall be held in perpetual trust and shall not be appropriated by the legislature or expended or disbursed for any purpose other than to acquire eligible investments in accordance with the provisions of this amendment. All eligible investments acquired, in whole or in part, with moneys constituting part of the trust capital shall to the extent of such moneys constitute part of the trust capital, but any trust income derived therefrom shall be paid directly into the general fund as it is received by the board, subject to appropriation and withdrawal by the legislature.

(b) To the extent practicable, the board shall keep all moneys at any time held in the trust fund invested in such eligible investments as shall, in its sole and uncontrolled judgment, produce the greatest trust income over the term of such investments while preserving the trust capital. In making any investment of moneys held in the trust fund, the board shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such investment, which an institutional investor of the highest standard of prudence, intelligence and financial expertise would exercise in the management and investment of large assets entrusted to it not for the purpose of speculative profit but for the permanent generation and disposition of funds, considering the probable safety of capital as well as the expected amount and frequency of income. The board shall have full power and authority to select the eligible investments in which moneys held in the trust fund shall at any time be invested, and, to the extent not inconsistent with any express provision of this amendment, the eligible investments so selected shall be acquired from such issuers, underwriters, brokers or other sellers on such terms and conditions; shall be acquired for purchase prices reflecting such discount below or premium above the par or face amount thereof; shall bear such dates and be in such form, denominations and series; shall mature or be subject to mandatory redemption on such dates; shall bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such intervals or, alternatively, shall provide income to the holder thereof in such manner (including, without limitation thereto, the purchase of such investments at a discount which represents all or part of the income or profit derived therefrom); shall be unsecured or secured in such manner and subject to the provisions of Section 2, paragraphs 2 and 3; shall contain such provisions for prepayment or redemption at the option of the issuer or obligor; and shall contain or be subject to such other provisions as shall, in all of the foregoing respects, be determined by the board in exercise of its sole and uncontrolled judgment.

## Amendment 471
**Special District Tax for Public Hospital Purposes in Baldwin County.**

The special district tax now levied and collected for public hospital purposes in election precincts numbered one through seven of Baldwin county, Alabama, and authorized by law shall be continued upon approval of this constitutional amendment and by simultaneous approval of a majority of the qualified electors in election precincts one through seven of Baldwin county voting thereon in the constitutional election submitting this proposed amendment to the county electorate.

Upon such approval, the governing body of Baldwin county shall levy and cause to be collected annually, beginning October 1, 1987, for a period of 20 years, in addition to any taxes now authorized or that may be hereafter authorized by the Constitution and laws of Alabama, a special district tax of two mills on each one dollar ($1.00) assessed valuation of taxable property in election precincts numbered one through seven of Baldwin county, Alabama, to be used exclusively for public hospital purposes (as the term "public hospital purposes" is defined in amendment LXXVI [76] to the Alabama Constitution of 1901 proposed by Acts of 1949, page 897, submitted December 13, 1949, and proclaimed ratified December 21, 1949) within said election precincts numbered one through seven.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by the governing body of Baldwin county, such governing body may anticipate the proceeds therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, by issuing, without further election, interest bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax received by the county.

The governing body of Baldwin county shall have power to designate as the agency of the county, to construct, acquire, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities for said election precincts numbered one through seven any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county. When a public corporation shall have been so designated, the proceeds of said tax thereafter collected shall be paid to it and shall be used by it for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payments of the proceeds of said tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result in the impairment of the obligation of any contract theretofore made with respect to said tax. Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Baldwin county under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Baldwin county or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities shall be construed to be negotiable instruments notwithstanding the fact that they may be payable solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.

As used in this act, the term "election precincts" means the election precincts or beats of the county as they existed on July 27, 1965.

This amendment shall be self-executing.

Any foreign corporation, whether or not such corporation has qualified to do business in this state by filing with the secretary of state a certified copy of its articles of incorporation or association, may be sued only in those counties where such suit would be allowed if the said foreign corporation were a domestic corporation. The legislature shall, by general law, provide for the payment to the state of Alabama of a franchise tax by such corporation, but such franchise tax shall be based on the actual amount of capital employed in this state. Strictly benevolent, educational, or religious corporations shall not be required to pay such a tax.

## Amendment 474
**Effectiveness of Laws Providing for Expenditure of County Funds.**

No law, whether general, special or local, whose purpose or effect is to provide for a new or increased expenditure of county funds held or disbursed by the county governing body shall become effective as to any county of this state until the first day of the fiscal year next following the passage of such law. The foregoing notwithstanding, a law, whether general, special or local, whose purpose or effect is to provide for a new or increased expenditure of county funds held or disbursed by the county governing body, shall become effective according to its own terms as any other law if: (1) such law is approved by a resolution duly adopted by and spread upon the minutes of the county governing body of the county affected thereby; or (2) such law (or other law or laws which specifically refer to such law) provides the respective county governing bodies with new or additional revenues sufficient to fund such new or increased expenditures.

## Amendment 475
**Tax Increment Districts in Counties and Municipalities.**

Any other provision of the Constitution heretofore adopted to the contrary notwithstanding, the legislature is hereby authorized to enact legislation permitting municipalities and counties to establish tax increment districts, as may be defined in such legislation; to authorize the payment to any such municipality or county of the increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from the redevelopment or revitalization of any such district except to the extent that any such payment would jeopardize the payment of any bonded indebtedness secured by any tax applicable in the proposed district; and subject to the mutual agreement of the municipality and county affected thereby to provide that all such increases in ad valorem taxes shall be payable to such municipality or county until the indebtedness or costs incurred for any project have been paid in full; to provide that public moneys, including the proceeds of obligations issued by the municipality or county for such purposes, may be expended for the acquisition of property and the redevelopment, rehabilitation or conservation thereof which may be disposed of to or for the benefit of private interest for compensation established by the governing body of county or municipality, as the case may be which established such district, but for not less than the fair market value thereof determined by one or more independent appraisals of such property; and to provide that any such obligations shall not be chargeable against the constitutional debt limit of the issuer unless such obligations shall be general obligations of the issuer in addition to being payable from such increases in property taxes. Any legislation passed at the same session of the legislature at which this amendment is proposed, which shall be in furtherance of or in implementation of the authority hereby granted is hereby validated and confirmed.

## Amendment 476

(D) Any successor appointments and appointments to vacancies shall be made in the same manner as described in subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) above, and members appointed after the initial term of that office has expired shall serve for six-year terms, except that no member shall serve consecutive six-year terms.

(E) It is the intent of this Amendment that the eastern and western areas of the three geographical regions of the state shall be represented on the Board of Trustees.

(6) Each person appointed to the Board shall be and remain an Alabama resident and shall have a demonstrated knowledge of and commitment to land acquisition for the purposes of conservation and recreation. Organizations making recommendations to the appointing officials shall be Alabama organizations or the Alabama chapter of national organizations in order to ensure that the decisions affecting Alabama's future are made by Alabama residents.

The recommending groups are composed as follows:

(A) "Group A" shall consist of non-profit organizations, each having its principal programs extending generally throughout the State, whose demonstrated primary concerns are environmental protection for the state and its citizens and non-consumptive use and preservation of natural areas, and whose membership exceeds 750 individual residents of Alabama, including, but not limited to, The Nature Conservancy of Alabama, the Alabama Audubon Council (comprising the chapters in Alabama of the National Audubon Society), The Alabama Conservancy, the Alabama Chapter of the Sierra Club, and their respective successor organizations.

(B) "Group B" shall consist of business, industry, trade associations and professional organizations, each having its principal programs extending generally throughout the state, and having a demonstrated concern for balancing economic growth with protection for the environment and increased recreational opportunities, including, but not limited to, the Business Council of Alabama, the Alabama Forestry Association, Alabama Forest Resources Center, the Alabama Farmers Federation, the Petroleum Council of Alabama, the Association of County Commissions of Alabama, and their respective successor organizations.

(C) "Group C" shall consist of non-profit organizations, each having its principal programs extending generally throughout the state, whose demonstrated primary purposes are to promote hunting, fishing, camping or other compatible recreational activities or conservation for such purposes, and whose membership exceeds 750 individual residents of Alabama, including, but not limited to, the Alabama Wildlife Federation, the Alabama State Advisory Council of Ducks Unlimited, Bowhunters of Alabama Inc., the Coastal Land Trust, Inc., the Gulf Coast Conservation Association, the Tennessee Valley Waterfowl Association, the Alabama Rifle and Pistol Association, the Alabama Chapter of the Safari Club International (whether or not those named organizations meet the membership requirement), and their respective successor organizations.

(D) In order to qualify as a recommending organization, each organization not specifically listed in this section must file with the Secretary of State and with the named organizations within the same "group", by January 1 preceding the date of expiration of term of office of Trustees hereunder, a written statement of intent to nominate persons to serve on the Board. This statement must include a request for designation of the "group" within which the organization plans to nominate Trustees and information demonstrating that the organization qualifies to make such nominations. It shall also include a copy of the organization's charter, stating its purpose. Should the Secretary of State or any of the named organizations within the same group oppose in writing the eligibility of the new organization to nominate members of the Board or the designation of the "group" within which it proposes to nominate members, then the Secretary of State shall determine the eligibility of the applying organization to submit nominations for membership on the Board and, if determined eligible, the "group" within which it shall submit nominations. In making this decision, the Secretary of State shall give due consideration to the views submitted to him by the organizations in the "group" within which the new organization proposes to submit nominations. An organization, together with its affiliates, cannot recommend names to the appointing officials as a member of more than one "group".

Each organization submitting nominations may submit, to the appropriate appointing official for that position on the Board, the names of not more than two of its members who have the qualifications to serve in the position for which they are being nominated. In the event that no organization within a group recommends names to the appointing official, then that official may appoint a Trustee from that group solely of his own choice.

(E) Terms of office of the initial Trustees shall begin on the January 1 following ratification of this Amendment, or on the first day of the third month following said ratification, whichever shall first occur. Terms of office of successor Trustees shall begin and end on anniversaries of that date. In the case of the initial appointments of Trustees, nominations shall be made to the appropriate appointing officials not later than one month after ratification of this Amendment, and appointments by said officials shall be made by the date of beginning of the initial Trustees' terms of office. Nominations of successor Trustees shall be made to the appropriate appointing officials not later than two months prior to the expiration of the Trustees' terms of office, and said officials shall appoint new Trustees within 30 calendar days after the expiration of said terms. In the event a Trustee resigns or dies, or otherwise vacates his office, the Commissioner or the Secretary of State shall promptly notify the appropriate nominating organizations and shall publish notice of such vacancy once a week for three successive weeks in three newspapers of regional circulation in this state with a request for new nominations from any group that may qualify to do so under the provisions of this Amendment. Nominations for a replacement Trustee shall be made to the appointing official during the 30 calendar days following such death, resignation or other vacation of office, and the appointing official shall appoint a replacement Trustee not later than the end of the next succeeding 30 calendar days thereafter. In the event the appropriate appointing official fails to make an initial appointment or an appointment within said 30-day periods for appointment after expiration of term of office or after death, resignation or other vacation of office, the right to make an appointment to fill that vacancy shall fall to the next appointing official in line of rotation of the Governor to the Lieutenant Governor to the Speaker of the House (with the Governor then to follow the Speaker); and, if that successor appointing official fails to make such appointment within 30 days, then the right to make the appointment shall fall to the next succeeding appointing official, all to the end that there will, as nearly as possible, always be a full complement of Trustees on the Board. Trustees appointed to fill a vacancy other than by reason of expiration of term of office shall serve the remainder of the unexpired term of the Trustee being replaced.

Section 5. Rights, Powers, and Duties of the Board.

(a) The Board is to meet at least quarterly each year for the transaction of its business and to review the progress of the Forever Wild Land Trust. It shall review written requests from state agencies, private organizations, and private citizens proposing that certain properties or interests therein be acquired. For purposes of establishing a quorum, there must be present at least three-fifths (3/5) of the members of the Board then in office at any Board meeting in order to conduct business; provided, however, that in absence of a quorum, the members present, by majority vote, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend.

Using its own knowledge and expertise, as well as the knowledge and expertise of the scientific community and state and federal agencies, the Board shall adopt a priority list of properties to be considered for acquisition. Recognizing that real estate transactions must involve willing sellers and may involve complicated procedures that could affect the availability of property, the Department shall, to the extent practicable, follow the directions of the Board in acquiring lands or waters. Provided, however, the Forever Wild Land Trust may only purchase or acquire an interest in property from the priority list of properties adopted by the Board.

(b) In addition to the site-specific management and allowable use guidelines referred to in Section 9, the Board may recommend to the Department rules, regulations and management criteria, which the Board feels would be beneficial to carrying out the goals and purposes of this Amendment.

(e) Before purchasing or acquiring any interest in lands with moneys from the Forever Wild Land Trust, the Board, acting through the Commissioner, or the Commissioner on his own initiative, shall obtain at least two appraisals from certified real estate appraisers. In no event shall the Board expend more than the "appraised value", as defined in Section 2 of this Amendment, in purchasing such lands; provided, however, that by affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the Board, the Board may expend up to 125 percent of the appraised value for such purchase where such action is necessary to accomplish the purposes and goals of this Amendment.

(f) The Board may assume indebtedness on behalf of the Forever Wild Land Trust that may be owed with respect to real or personal property given, donated, contributed or devised to the Forever Wild Land Trust, or that may be secured by a mortgage, deed of trust or security interest covering such property, and to agree to pay such indebtedness from current assets or future revenues of the Forever Wild Land Trust; provided that the present value of all installments of principal and of interest on such indebtedness at the time of the assumption thereof, determined in accordance with accepted principles and using a discount rate equal to the rate of interest payable on such indebtedness, shall be less than 80% of the fair market value of such property as determined by an active public market for such property or an appraisal performed by an independent, professionally qualified appraiser.

(g) The Board may contract for the purchase of tracts or parcels of land in which the purchase price shall be payable in future installments, together with such rate of interest on the unpaid balance of such purchase price as the Board shall determine to be reasonable, and to secure the payment of such installments, together with the interest thereon, by purchase money mortgages on the land so acquired and by a pledge of future revenues committed to the Forever Wild Land Trust, including, without limitation thereto, any portion of the trust income allocated to said trust by Section 7 of this Amendment; provided that such installments shall in no event exceed 80% of the fair market value of such property determined as set forth in the preceding subsection and provided further that the total cumulative indebtedness assumed each year under the preceding sub-section (f) together with the total cumulative indebtedness incurred each year by purchase money mortgages as provided in this sub-section (g) shall be limited to no more than 25% of the trust income allocated to said trust for the preceding year.

(h) The Board may enter into contracts with any person, nonprofit organization, corporation, governmental entity or other entity concerning tracts or parcels of land that constitute desirable acquisitions for the Forever Wild Land Trust pursuant to which such person, nonprofit organization, corporation, governmental entity or other entity will agree to acquire and hold such land, or to hold such land if theretofore acquired by such person, nonprofit organization, corporation, governmental entity or other entity and to sell or donate such land to the Forever Wild Land Trust at some future date, in the interim preserving and managing such land in its natural state subject to such conditions, including the reimbursement of expenses, as the Board shall deem advantageous for the ultimate acquisition and preservation of such land.

(i) The Board may sell, lease or exchange specific properties or interests therein acquired or held by the Alabama Trust Fund for the Forever Wild Land Trust. Any such sale or exchange shall be made at not less than the "appraised value", as defined in Section 2 of this Amendment; provided, however, that by affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the Board, the Board may authorize and direct the Commissioner to sell or exchange property of said trust for not less than 85 percent of the appraised value where such action is necessary to accomplish the purposes and goals of the Amendment. All moneys received from any such sale or lease shall be paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust.

(j) The Board shall establish a technical advisory committee, consisting of the State Forester, the President of the Alabama Chapter of the Wildlife Society, the State Geologist, and any other person whom the Board may desire to appoint, for the purpose of obtaining advice and assistance in performing the Board's functions and duties under this Amendment.

(k) In addition, the Board is authorized at its discretion:

(1) to establish procedures relating to the confidentiality of information where necessary to accomplish the purposes and goals of this Amendment;

(2) to cooperate or contract with any federal, state or local government agency, private organization, or individual to accomplish any of the purposes and goals of this Amendment, paying any reasonable fees or expenses in connection with such cooperation or contracts from moneys held under or within the Forever Wild Land Trust;

(3) to recommend that moneys paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust be allowed to accumulate, with only the income thereon being spent, or that the corpus or principal of the Forever Wild Land Trust be expended in whole or in part;

(4) to do any and all things necessary to take advantage of federal, state, or local government or private funds donated or obtainable through the use of the Forever Wild Land Trust; and

(5) to adopt, alter and repeal bylaws, regulations and rules in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act for the regulation and conduct of its affairs and business in accordance with the provisions of the Alabama Administrative Procedures Act.

(l) Members of the Board and the technical advisory committee shall be entitled to receive the per diem allowance and travel expenses provided by law to state employees. These expense payments shall be for the sole purpose of travel to and from their places of residence to meetings and for travel involving official business of the Forever Wild Land Trust. Those members who are state officials or employees shall serve without compensation or expense allowances other than that to which they are otherwise entitled in the positions they hold.

(m) The Commissioner and the Department are hereby specifically authorized and empowered to carry out all directions and recommendations of the Board made hereunder to accomplish the purposes of the Forever Wild Land Trust and this Amendment.

Section 6. Final Approval Committee.

There is hereby established a Final Approval Committee to be composed of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Before purchasing or leasing any property, or acquiring any interest therein, with any funds from the Forever Wild Land Trust or selling any properties previously purchased from the Forever Wild Land Trust, the Board shall submit to the Final Approval Committee a written proposal of the purchase, lease, sale or acquisition of any other interest in property. Said proposal shall include a legal description of the property to be purchased, leased or sold; the proposed purchase, lease or sale price; and any additional terms of the sale, purchase, lease or other interest therein. The Final Approval Committee shall approve or disapprove the proposal by a majority vote of the full membership of said Committee within 30 days after the date of submission of the proposal. Failure of the Committee to act within 30 days of submission shall constitute approval of said proposal.

Section 7. Source of Funds.

(a) Beginning with the state's 1992-1993 fiscal year, there shall be allocated and paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust the percentage of trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund that would have been reinvested in the Alabama Trust Fund under Section 4(c) of Amendment Number 450 to this Alabama Constitution of 1901. Notwithstanding Section 4(c) of Amendment Number 450 to the Alabama Constitution of 1901, the percentage of trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund shall be allocated to the Forever Wild Land Trust as follows:

(1) For the 1992-1993 fiscal year, four percent (4%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(2) For the 1993-1994 fiscal year, five percent (5%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(b) The Alabama Trust Fund Board shall provide the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust with advice and assistance in the investment of funds in the Forever Wild Land Trust.

(c) Title to the property acquired from funds in the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be held in the Alabama Trust Fund for the State of Alabama. Provided, however, the Alabama Trust Fund Board shall not have any responsibility for nor any control over the approving or disapproving of the acquisition, disposition or use of any such property. Nothing in this Amendment or Amendment 450 to this Alabama Constitution of 1901 shall be construed so as to require the Alabama Trust Fund Board to have a fiduciary responsibility for the investment of Forever Wild Land Trust funds or the production of income from property acquired by the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust.

(d) The amounts allocated to the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be included in determining whether the trust income received by the state from the Alabama Trust Fund equals or exceeds $60,000,000 for the purposes of the County Government Capital Improvement Act (codified at Sections 11-29-1 through 11-29-7 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended) and the Municipal Government Capital Improvement Act (codified at Sections 11-66-1 through 11-66-7 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended). In no event shall any provision hereof serve to decrease the amount of income from the Alabama Trust Fund which is to be appropriated to the Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund and the County Government Capital Improvement Fund under the above-referenced acts.

Section 8. Donations of Property.

Any person making a donation of any property or any interest therein, to the state for the purposes of this Amendment, shall receive, irrespective of any other provisions of the income tax laws of the state, twice the ordinary deduction for state income tax purposes for the taxable year in which the property or interest is donated. Provided, however, the value of any such property or interest therein, subject to this double deduction, shall be limited to the actual value of the property, or any interest therein, donated to the state which shall not include any indebtedness, encumbrances or liens assumed by the Forever Wild Land Trust or the value of any interests or rights retained by the donor.

For the purposes of this section, the "actual value" of property shall be the appraised value for ad valorem taxation purposes, averaged over the preceding five years.

Section 9. Stewardship Account.

The Alabama Trust Fund Board shall establish a separate account within the Alabama Trust Fund to be known as the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account. When the Forever Wild Land Trust acquires property or an interest in property pursuant to this Amendment, the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust shall set aside an amount from the Forever Wild Land Trust equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the appraised value of the land acquired, or the land affected if less than a fee interest was acquired. The Alabama Trust Fund Board shall provide for the investment of the Stewardship Account. The Board of Trustees of the Alabama Forever Wild Land Trust may authorize the Department to expend any interest income generated from the investment of funds within the Stewardship Account by the Alabama Trust Fund Board. Provided, however, the Commissioner shall notify the Board of Trustees in writing if he determines that the interest income projected to be generated from the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account for the next fiscal year will be insufficient to properly manage property acquired by the Forever Wild Land Trust. The Board may authorize by a three-fifths (3/5) vote that funds within the corpus of the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account be expended by the Department for management purposes for the next fiscal year, provided that funds from the Stewardship Account may not be expended to purchase additional property or interests therein. Within one year after the Forever Wild Land Trust acquires any properties pursuant to this Amendment, the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust shall develop management and allowable use guidelines which shall be followed by the Department in the administration and stewardship of that piece of property. The Lands Division of the Department shall, in accordance with such general directions as may be given by the Board of Trustees, coordinate management of properties acquired pursuant to this Amendment and expenditures from the Stewardship Account. All lands will be managed under the multiple-use management principle; to insure that all resource values including recreation, hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, aesthetics, soil, water, forest management and minerals are protected or enhanced. No use will be allowed that is not compatible with the primary purpose for acquiring the land. In coordinating such management within the Department, the Game and Fish Division of the Department shall manage wildlife and fisheries programs; the State Parks Division of the Department shall manage parks programs; the Lands Division of the Department shall manage natural areas programs through its Natural Heritage Program; and the Lands Division of the Department shall manage other activities and programs relating to Forever Wild Land Trust properties. The Forestry Commission shall serve as consultant to the Department for the purpose of managing the forest and forestry resources programs. Any income that may be generated from the property or from any use of said property acquired through the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be treated as interest income of the Alabama Trust Fund and shall accrue to the credit of the general fund of the State of Alabama.

The right of the public to hunt and fish on the lands and easements acquired under the provisions of this act shall not be abridged or restricted, subject to such rules, regulations, seasons and limits as are established by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

Section 10. Enforceability of Conservation Restrictions; Recordation; Acquisition and Disposal of Interests.

(a) No conservation restriction or easement as defined in Section 2 of this Amendment held by any governmental body shall be unenforceable on account of lack of privity of estate or contract or lack of benefit to particular land or on account of the benefit being assignable to or being assigned to any other governmental body with like purposes. All such restrictions and easements shall be duly recorded and indexed in the manner of other conveyances of interests in land, and shall describe the land subject to the restrictions or easements by adequate legal description or by reference to a recorded plat showing its boundaries.

Such conservation restrictions are interests in land and may be acquired by any governmental body which has power to acquire interests in land, in the same manner as it may acquire other interests in land. Such a restriction or easement may be enforced by injunction or proceeding in equity, and shall entitle the holder of it to enter the land in a reasonable manner and at reasonable times to assure compliance. Such a restriction or easement may be released in whole or in part, by the holder for such consideration, if any, as the holder may determine, in the same manner as the holder may dispose of land or other interest in land, subject to such conditions as may have been imposed at the time of creation of the restriction.

This section shall not be construed to imply that any restriction, easement, covenant or condition which does not have the benefit of this section shall, on account of any provision hereof, be unforceable. Nothing in this Amendment shall diminish the powers granted by any law to acquire by purchase, gift, eminent domain or otherwise as restricting the use of an existing or future easement, express or implied, in favor of any utility or other holder of an easement for public purpose. The existence of conservation easements or restrictions shall not of itself be proof of value as a measure of damages in any eminent domain proceedings.

(b) When a conservation restriction or easement is held by public body under the program established by this Amendment, the real property subject thereto shall be assessed for taxation purposes on the basis of the true cash value of the property or as otherwise provided by law, less such reduction in value as may result from the granting of the conservation restriction or easement. The value of the interest held by the public body shall be exempt from property taxation to the same extent as other public property.

Section 11. Alabama Natural Heritage Program.

(a) The Alabama Natural Heritage Program is hereby established as a part of the Lands Division of the Department, or its duly designated successor, and shall be funded from the Forever Wild Land Trust or the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account as provided by the Board, and from private donations.

(b) For purposes of this program, the Department, subject to approval by the Board, shall:

(1) Produce an inventory of Alabama's natural heritage resources, including their location and ecological status.

(2) Maintain a natural heritage data bank of inventory data and other relevant information for ecologically significant sites supporting natural heritage resources. Information from this data bank may be made available to public agencies and to private institutions or individuals for environmental assessment and land management purposes.

(3) Develop a Natural Heritage Plan which suggests priorities for the protection, acquisition and management of dedicated natural area preserves.

(4) Establish procedures relating to the confidentiality of data and inquiries for information in order to protect natural resources and encourage use by public agencies and private organizations and individuals in planning or conducting their activities.

Section 12. Dedication of Natural Area Preserves.

(a) The Department shall, in the name of the State and upon the recommendation of the Board, accept the dedication of natural areas on lands deemed by the Board and the Commissioner to qualify as natural area preserves under the provisions of this Amendment. Natural area preserves may be offered for dedication by voluntary act of the owner. The owner of a qualified natural area may transfer fee simple title or other interest in land to the State. Natural area preserves may be acquired by gift, grant or purchase.

(b) Dedication of a natural area preserve shall become effective only upon acceptance of the instrument of dedication by the Board and the Commissioner.

(c) The instrument of dedication may:

(1) Contain restrictions and other provisions relating to management, use, development, transfer, and public access, and may contain any other restrictions and provisions as may be necessary or advisable to further the purposes of this Amendment;

(2) Define, consistent with the purposes of this Amendment, the respective rights and duties of the owner and of the state and provide procedures to be followed in case of violations of the restrictions;

(3) Recognize and create reversionary rights, transfers upon condition or with limitations, and gifts over; and

(4) Vary in provisions from one natural area preserve to another in accordance with differences in the characteristics and conditions of the several areas.

(d) Public departments, commissions, boards, counties, municipalities, corporations, colleges, universities and all other agencies and instrumentalities of the state and its political subdivisions may dedicate suitable areas within their jurisdiction as natural area preserves in accordance with the powers and authorities granted to such organizations by existing state legislation.

(e) The Board may enter into amendments to the instrument of dedication upon finding that such amendments will not permit an impairment, disturbance, use, or development of the area inconsistent with the provisions of this Amendment. If the fee simple estate in the natural area preserve is not held by the state under this article, no amendment may be made without the written consent of the owner of the other interests therein.

Section 13. Sunset Provision.

Beginning with the state's 2012-2013 fiscal year and each succeeding fiscal year, all moneys to be paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be paid to the Alabama Trust Fund in the event the Legislature has not provided for the continuation of payments into the Forever Wild Land Trust Fund as provided for in this section, provided that 2.5% of the trust income earned from the investment of funds in the Alabama Trust Fund shall continue to be paid to the Forever Wild Stewardship Account established in Section 9 of this Amendment until such time as the Legislature, by legislative act, determines that interest income earned from the investment of funds within the corpus of the Stewardship Account is sufficient for the proper administration and stewardship of properties acquired from the Forever Wild Land Trust. And provided further, that the Legislature, by legislative act, or by the enactment of a constitutional amendment may continue payment of the revenues provided in Section 7 hereof, or at any time provide for the payment of other revenues, into the Forever Wild Land Trust. At such time as the payment of trust income into the Forever Wild Land Trust shall cease, the percentage of trust income accruing to said trust fund shall be paid into the Alabama Trust Fund each year to become a part of the corpus of the Alabama Trust Fund.

Section 14. Amendment Self-Executing.

This Amendment shall be self-executing, but the Legislature shall have the right and power to enact laws supplemental hereto and in furtherance of the purposes and objectives hereof, provided that such laws are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Amendment.

Section 15. Severability.

If any provision of this Amendment, or the application of any provision to any entity, person, or circumstance is for any reason adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the remainder of this Amendment and its application shall not be affected.

## Amendment 551
**Special Ad Valorem Taxes for Fire Protection and Emergency Services in Montgomery County.**

The Legislature declares that all volunteer fire departments, including volunteer fire departments that have emergency medical technicians that are members, are organizations that are public in nature and serve to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Montgomery County.

In addition to all ad valorem taxes levied for fire protection, the Montgomery County Commission may levy and collect a special ad valorem tax, not to exceed two and one-half mills in any year on each dollar of assessed value of the property taxed, on property in the unincorporated area of Montgomery County for the purpose of providing fire protection in the unincorporated area of Montgomery County.

The tax provided in this act shall be levied, collected, administered, and enforced at the same time, in the same manner, and under the same requirements and laws as state ad valorem taxes. The officials collecting or assessing the tax shall be entitled to the same fees and compensation as are provided for collecting and assessing ad valorem taxes. The proceeds of the tax shall be paid into the county general fund. Within thirty days after payment into the county general fund, the Montgomery County Commission shall pay the funds to the Montgomery County Association of Volunteer Firefighters, hereafter referred to as the county association. The county association shall distribute the funds as follows:

(1) 60 percent shall be divided equally among all eligible volunteer fire departments.

(2) 30 percent shall be divided according to a percentage based upon the monies collected in a fire district compared to the total monies collected. The county association shall notify the Revenue Commissioner within 30 days after this act becomes operative of the designated fire districts. The boundaries of the fire districts may be rearranged at the discretion of the county association as they deem necessary, from time to time, to maximize fire protection services in the county.

(3) Ten percent of the money shall be designated as discretionary fund of the county association to be used for any expenditure otherwise allowable under this act.

In order to be an eligible volunteer fire department for purposes of this act, a volunteer fire department shall be in good standing with the Montgomery County Association of Volunteer Firefighters.

Funds disbursed to eligible volunteer fire departments pursuant to this act shall be expended only for fire protection and emergency medical services, including but not limited to, training, supplies, buildings, capital improvements, equipment, insurance, professional services, and dues. The funds shall not be expended for food, drink, social activities, or fund-raising activities. After receiving the funds, the volunteer fire departments shall keep accurate records to verify that the funds are properly expended. By September 15th of each year, the department shall file a report with the county association detailing the expenditure of all funds during the previous twelve months and setting out a schedule of all proposed projects. The filing shall account for all unspent funds and whether unspent funds have been obligated. Unspent funds that have not been obligated which exceed the amount of total receipts paid to the department for the prior year from this tax shall be returned to the county association for redistribution equally among the other fire departments. The county association shall supply the accounting forms to each eligible volunteer fire department. The copy of the year-end report shall be filed with the county commission and shall be audited by the Examiners of Public Accounts of the state on the same basis as county funds are audited.

Upon dissolution or abandonment of an eligible volunteer fire department, all remaining funds derived from this act or assets purchased with the funds derived from this act shall be transferred to the county association.

Prior to the levy of the fire protection tax in the unincorporated areas of county, there shall be submitted to the electors at a special election called for that purpose in the county, the question of whether the tax shall be levied.

## Amendment 622
**Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment.**

SECTION I. The amendment shall be known as and may be cited as the Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment.

SECTION II. The Legislature makes the following findings concerning religious freedom:

(1) The framers of the United States Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution, and the framers of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, also recognizing this right, secured the protection of religious freedom in Article I, Section 3.

(2) Federal and state laws "neutral" toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise.

(3) Governments should not burden religious exercise without compelling justification.

(4) In Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the United States Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward religion.

(5) The compelling interest test as set forth in prior court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing governmental interests in areas ranging from public education (pedagogical interests and religious rights, including recognizing regulations necessary to alleviate interference with the educational process versus rights of religious freedom) to national defense (conscription and conscientious objection, including the need to raise an army versus rights to object to individual participation), and other areas of important mutual concern.

(6) Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C., § 2000bb, to establish the compelling interest test set forth in prior federal court rulings, but in City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (1997), the United States Supreme Court held the act unconstitutional stating that the right to regulate was retained by the states.

SECTION III. The purpose of the Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment is to guarantee that the freedom of religion is not burdened by state and local law; and to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious freedom is burdened by government.

SECTION IV. As used in this amendment, the following words shall have the following meanings:

(1) DEMONSTRATES. Meets the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.

(2) FREEDOM OF RELIGION. The free exercise of religion under Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.

(3) GOVERNMENT. Any branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under the color of law) of the State of Alabama, any political subdivision of a state, municipality, or other local government.

(4) RULE. Any government statute, regulation, ordinance, administrative provision, ruling guideline, requirement, or any statement of law whatever.

SECTION V. (a) Government shall not burden a person's freedom of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b).

(b) Government may burden a person's freedom of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person:

(1) Is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and

(2) Is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.

(c) A person whose religious freedom has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.

SECTION VI. (a) This amendment applies to all government rules and implementations thereof, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after the effective date of this amendment.

(b) Nothing in this amendment shall be construed to authorize any government to burden any religious belief.

(c) Nothing in this amendment shall be construed to affect, interpret, or in any way address those portions of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution permitting the free exercise of religion or prohibiting laws respecting the establishment of religion, or those provisions of Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, regarding the establishment of religion.

SECTION VII. (a) This amendment shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial and deterrent purposes.

(b) If any provision of this amendment or its application to any particular person or circumstance is held invalid, that provision or its application is severable and does not affect the validity of other provisions or applications of this amendment.

## Amendment 623

Any royalty or other payment, with the exception of any taxes heretofore or hereafter levied, that is based upon or determined with respect to the production of oil, gas or other hydrocarbon minerals and that is paid to the state or any agency or instrumentality thereof, regardless of the time of such payment, shall be considered an oil and gas capital payment.

Section II. (a) Within thirty days following ratification of this constitutional amendment there shall be created within the Alabama Trust Fund the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account. Upon creation, the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account shall be credited with Oil and Gas Capital Payments previously transferred into the Alabama Trust Fund up to an amount equal to six percent of the Education Trust Fund appropriations for fiscal year 2002. Once established, no further amounts from the Alabama Trust Fund may be credited to the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account except repayments as provided in subsection (b) below. Funds from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account may be withdrawn only to prevent proration of the appropriations for the public schools, public colleges and universities, public schools for the deaf and blind, including all appropriations to the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, public schools for the mentally ill and retarded, and other entities established by general statute for public school students from the Education Trust Fund subject to the following limitations. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002 funds may not be withdrawn from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account unless legislation is enacted during the 2001 4th Special Session of the Legislature which increases Education Trust Fund revenues and reduces Education Trust Fund expenditures by a combined amount of $160 million as certified by the Legislative Fiscal Officer to the Legislature at the same time as the certifications pursuant to Section 16-13-281(c) are made.  Beginning in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2002 withdrawals from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account shall be limited to an amount necessary to reach the average of the estimated available revenue which is to be certified by the Finance Director and the Legislative Fiscal Officer at the same time as the certifications pursuant to Section 16-13-281(c) Code of Alabama 1975 are made. The Governor shall certify to the state comptroller and notify the Legislature that proration would occur in appropriations for the public schools, public colleges and universities, public schools for the deaf and blind, including all appropriations to the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, public schools for the mentally ill and retarded, and other entities established by general statute for public school students from the Education Trust Fund in accordance with this constitution. Upon the certification by the Governor, and after all other sources available to be used to offset proration have been utilized, withdrawals from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account may be made; however, withdrawals shall be limited to the amount of the anticipated proration and funds allotted only to the extent necessary to avoid proration of appropriations for the public schools, public colleges and universities, public schools for the deaf and blind, including all appropriations to the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, public schools for the mentally ill and retarded, and other entities established by general statute for public school students from the Education Trust Fund as limited by this section. In the event funds are withdrawn from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent of the Education Trust Fund transfer amount shall be transferred from the Alabama Trust Fund to the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund.

(b) The Finance Director shall ensure that if during the fiscal year, receipts to the Education Trust Fund (net of the Education Trust Rainy Day Account payments) are sufficient to reduce proration of funds for the public schools, public colleges and universities, public schools for the deaf and blind, including all appropriations to the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, public schools for the mentally ill and retarded, and other entities established by general statute for public school students which has been declared and for which funds have been withdrawn, then the amount corresponding to the reduced proration percentage shall be transferred back to the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund within thirty days after the end of the fiscal year in which the withdrawals were made. Any amount transferred back to the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account shall necessitate a transfer of an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent of that amount from the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund into the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund.

(c) The Legislature may provide by statute for the replenishment of the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund from sources other than the Alabama Trust Fund or Oil and Gas Capital Payments. The earnings from the investment of funds due to the replenishment shall be deposited into the State General Fund.

(d) The allocations to the Alabama Capital Improvement Trust Fund and to the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund as provided in Amendment 666 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, shall not be diminished by the application of this amendment.

(e) The Legislature must provide for the replenishment of the account within five (5) years after withdrawal of any funds from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account pursuant to the provisions of this amendment. After the complete replenishment of the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account, any excess funds shall be designated to repay any lost interest earnings to the trust established under Amendment 543 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, due to any withdrawal from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account.

## Amendment 710

## Amendment 711
**Amendment of Amendment No. 551**

Amendment No. 551 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, is amended to read as follows:

The Legislature declares that all volunteer fire departments, including volunteer fire departments that have emergency medical technicians that are members, are organizations that are public in nature and serve to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Montgomery County.

In addition to all ad valorem taxes levied for fire protection, the Montgomery County Commission may levy and collect a special ad valorem tax, not to exceed  five mills in any year on each dollar of assessed value of the property taxed, on property in the unincorporated area of Montgomery County for the purpose of providing fire protection in the unincorporated area of Montgomery County.

The tax provided in this act shall be levied, collected, administered, and enforced at the same time, in the same manner, and under the same requirements and laws as state ad valorem taxes. The officials collecting or assessing the tax shall be entitled to the same fees and compensation as are provided for collecting and assessing ad valorem taxes. The proceeds of the tax shall be paid into the county general fund. Within thirty days after payment into the county general fund, the Montgomery County Commission shall pay the funds to the Montgomery County Association of Volunteer Firefighters, hereafter referred to as the county association. The county association shall distribute the funds as follows:

(1) 60 percent shall be divided equally among all eligible volunteer fire departments.

(2) 30 percent shall be divided according to a percentage based upon the monies collected in a fire district compared to the total monies collected. The county association shall notify the Revenue Commissioner within 30 days after this act becomes operative of the designated fire districts. The boundaries of the fire districts may be rearranged at the discretion of the county association as they deem necessary, from time to time, to maximize fire protection services in the county.

(3) Ten percent of the money shall be designated as discretionary fund of the county association to be used for any expenditure otherwise allowable under this act.

In order to be an eligible volunteer fire department for purposes of this act, a volunteer fire department shall be in good standing with the Montgomery County Association of Volunteer Firefighters.

Funds disbursed to eligible volunteer fire departments pursuant to this act shall be expended only for fire protection and emergency medical services, including but not limited to, training, supplies, buildings, capital improvements, equipment, insurance, professional services, and dues. The funds shall not be expended for food, drink, social activities, or fund-raising activities. After receiving the funds, the volunteer fire departments shall keep accurate records to verify that the funds are properly expended. By September 15th of each year, the department shall file a report with the county association detailing the expenditure of all funds during the previous twelve months and setting out a schedule of all proposed projects. The filing shall account for all unspent funds and whether unspent funds have been obligated. Unspent funds that have not been obligated which exceed the amount of total receipts paid to the department for the prior year from this tax shall be returned to the county association for redistribution equally among the other fire departments. The county association shall supply the accounting forms to each eligible volunteer fire department. The copy of the year-end report shall be filed with the county commission and shall be audited by the Examiners of Public Accounts of the state on the same basis as county funds are audited.

Upon dissolution or abandonment of an eligible volunteer fire department, all remaining funds derived from this act or assets purchased with the funds derived from this act shall be transferred to the county association.

Prior to the levy of the fire protection tax in the unincorporated areas of county, there shall be submitted to the electors at a special election called for that purpose in the county, the question of whether the tax shall be levied. If a majority of the qualified electors within the unincorporated area of the county who vote at the election approve the tax, the tax shall be effective and levied. If a majority of the qualified electors within the unincorporated area of the county who vote at the election do not approve the tax, the tax shall not be effective and shall not be levied.

Elections on the question of the levy of a fire protection tax in the county may be held at any time and from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at an election held after the ratification of this amendment the proposal to levy the tax so submitted is defeated, then the proposal may not be submitted at another election held in the county within two years from the last election held under this amendment.

## Amendment 712
**Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Services in Montgomery County.**

The special district tax now levied and collected for public hospital purposes in election precincts numbered one through seven of Baldwin County, Alabama, and authorized by law shall be continued upon approval of this constitutional amendment and by simultaneous approval of a majority of the qualified electors in election precincts one through seven of Baldwin County voting thereon in the constitutional election submitting this proposed amendment to the county electorate.

"Upon such approval, the governing body of Baldwin County shall levy and cause to be collected annually, beginning October 1, 2007, for a period of 20 years, in addition to any taxes now authorized or that may be hereafter authorized by the Constitution and laws of Alabama, a special district tax of two mills on each one dollar ($1.00) assessed valuation of taxable property in election precincts numbered one through seven of Baldwin County, Alabama, to be used exclusively for public hospital purposes (as the term "public hospital purposes" is defined in amendment LXXVI [76] to the Alabama Constitution of 1901 [§215.037] proposed by Acts of 1949, page 897, submitted December 13, 1949, and proclaimed ratified December 21, 1949) within said election precincts numbered one through seven.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by the governing body of Baldwin County, such governing body may anticipate the proceeds therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, by issuing, without further election, interest bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax received by the county.

The governing body of Baldwin County shall have power to designate as the agency of the county, to construct, acquire, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities for said election precincts numbered one through seven any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county. When a public corporation shall have been so designated, the proceeds of said tax thereafter collected shall be paid to it and shall be used by it for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payments of the proceeds of said tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result in the impairment of the obligation of any contract theretofore made with respect to said tax. Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Baldwin County under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Baldwin County or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of Section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of Section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities shall be construed to be negotiable instruments notwithstanding the fact that they may be payable solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.

As used in this act, the term "election precincts" means the election precincts or beats of the county as they existed on July 27, 1965.

This amendment shall be self-executing.

The governing body of the City of Prichard shall specify that the value of land and improvements within the tax district, except for property within the tax district that is centrally assessed by the Alabama Department of Revenue, shall be assessed for ad valorem tax purposes by the appropriate county tax officials according to a single site valuation system where land and improvements on the land are valued together rather than separately and taxed at a uniform rate.

None of the assets, proceeds, income, contributions, or payments shall be used, loaned, encumbered, or diverted to or for any other purpose whatsoever, except, that (a) a trust may be terminated, if the State has no obligation to provide post-employment health care benefits for which the trust was established to such persons, and, in that event, the remaining assets of the trust shall revert to the State Treasury to and for the credit of the State Employees' Insurance Board, the Public Education Employees' Health Insurance Board, or its successor or assign, as the case may be, related to the terminated trust or (b) if in response to a petition of the trustees of a trust requesting that the respective trust agreement be amended, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the amendment proposed by the trustees is necessary or otherwise advisable to accomplish one or more purposes of the act authorizing and directing the creation of the trusts.

Section III. (a) Within thirty days following ratification of this constitutional amendment there shall be created within the Alabama Trust Fund the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account and the General Fund Rainy Day Account. In any year in which the Governor certifies to the state comptroller and notifies the Legislature that proration would occur in appropriations from the Education Trust Fund or the State General Fund, the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account or the General Fund Rainy Day Account shall be credited with Oil and Gas Capital Payments previously transferred into the Alabama Trust Fund in the amount required to fund withdrawals from the Account of the amounts authorized by this section. However, the amount withdrawn from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account in a fiscal year may not exceed six and one-half percent of the previous fiscal year's Education Trust Fund appropriations less the total amount of any prior years' withdrawals from the Account which have not been repaid to the Account, as provided for in subsections (b), (c), and (e). The amount withdrawn from the General Fund Rainy Day Account in a fiscal year may not exceed ten percent of the previous fiscal year's General Fund appropriations less the total amount of any prior years' withdrawals from the Account which have not been repaid to the Account, as provided for in subsections (b), (c), and (e). Funds from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account may be withdrawn only to prevent proration of the appropriations from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund. For the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2008, withdrawals shall be limited to an amount necessary to reach the highest estimated available revenue for each Fund as certified by the Finance Director and the Legislative Fiscal Officer prior to the end of the 2008 Regular Legislative Session. Beginning in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2009, withdrawals from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account and the General Fund Rainy Day Account shall be limited to an amount necessary to reach the average of the estimated available revenue for each Fund which is to be certified by the Finance Director and the Legislative Fiscal Officer prior to the third legislative day of each Regular Session. The Governor shall certify to the state comptroller and notify the Legislature that proration would occur in appropriations from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund in accordance with this constitution. Upon the certification by the Governor, and after all other sources available to be used to offset proration have been utilized, withdrawals from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account or the General Fund Rainy Day Account may be made; however, withdrawals shall be limited to the amount of the anticipated proration and funds allotted only to the extent necessary to avoid proration of appropriations from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund as limited by this section. In the event funds are withdrawn from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent of the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund transfer amount shall be transferred from the Alabama Trust Fund to the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund.

(b) The Finance Director shall ensure that if during the fiscal year, receipts to the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund (net of the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account payments) are sufficient to reduce anticipated proration which has been certified by the Governor to the state comptroller and for which funds have been withdrawn, then the amount corresponding to the reduced anticipated proration percentage shall be transferred back to the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund within thirty days after the end of the fiscal year in which the withdrawals were made. Any amount transferred back to the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account shall necessitate a transfer of an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent of that amount from the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund into the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund.

(c) The Legislature may provide by statute for the replenishment of the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund from sources other than the Alabama Trust Fund or Oil and Gas Capital Payments. The earnings from the investment of funds due to the replenishment shall be deposited into the State General Fund.

(d) The allocations to the Alabama Capital Improvement Trust Fund and to the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund as provided in Amendment 666 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, now appearing as Section 219.04 of the Official Recompilation of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as amended, shall not be diminished by the application of this amendment.

(e) The Legislature must replenish the accounts within six (6) years after withdrawal of any funds from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account and within ten (10) years after withdrawal of any funds from the General Fund Rainy Day Account pursuant to the provisions of this amendment. After the complete replenishment of the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account, any excess funds shall be designated to repay any lost interest earnings to the trust established under Amendment 543 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, now appearing as Section 219.07 of the Official Recompilation of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as amended, due to any withdrawal from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account.
